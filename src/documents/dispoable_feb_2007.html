<p>
Your Prepaid MasterCard® card<br>
Customer Terms and Conditions<br>
To the Retailer: Please keep this copy and show to customers on request.<br>
Any questions, Retailers should call 0800 458 7149.<br>
Customers should call 0870 144 0280.<br>
1. Your Card<br>
1.1 Your Card is a prepaid electronic money (e-money) payment card. It is<br>
not a credit card.<br>
1.2 When you purchase your Card at a retail store, the retailer will load it<br>
with the amount of e-money that you purchase, subject to the<br>
available denominations as well as a maximum of £150 (or less, if we<br>
so require) and a minimum of £10. When you purchase a card via our<br>
website (www.idtprime.com), the maximum load is £500. The money<br>
loaded onto your Card is then available for you to spend once you<br>
activate your Card.<br>
1.3 You cannot load additional sums onto your Card after youhave<br>
purchased your Card. You can, however, purchase more Cards.<br>
1.4 The Available Funds on your Card will not earn any interest.<br>
1.5 As your Card is a prepaid card and not a credit card, you must ensure<br>
that you have sufficient Available Funds on your Card to pay for each<br>
purchase or payment that you make using your Card (including value<br>
added tax and any other taxes, charges and fees that are applicable).<br>
If for any reason a Transaction is processed with your Card where the<br>
Transaction amount exceeds the Available Funds on your Card, you<br>
must repay us the amount of such excess immediately.<br>
1.6 Your rights and obligations in relation to your Card are as set out in<br>
this Agreement. This Agreement does not give you any rights against<br>
MasterCard International, its affiliates or any third party.<br>
1.7 The Card remains our property at all times.<br>
1.8 Only persons over 18 years of age are entitled to purchase the Card.<br>
Once purchased, the Card may be given to another person, including a<br>
person under 18 years of age. However, Transactions by persons<br>
under 18 years of age may not be allowed by some Merchants.<br>
2. Use of your Card<br>
2.1 You can use your Card up to the amount of the Available Funds to<br>
enter into Transactions at Merchants displaying the MasterCard<br>
acceptance mark, including Transactions with Merchants over the<br>
internet, by phone or mail order. If the Available Funds are insufficient<br>
to pay for the Transaction, some Merchants will not permit you to<br>
combine use of the Card with other payment methods, e.g. cheque,<br>
cash or another payment card.<br>
2.2 You cannot use your Card to make cash withdrawals, whether from<br>
ATMs, banks, shops, or otherwise.<br>
2.3 The value of each Transaction and the amount of any fees or charges<br>
payable by you under this Agreement will be deducted from the<br>
Available Funds.<br>
2.4 In order to protect you and us from fraud, Merchants will seek<br>
authorisation before processing any Transaction. If a Merchant is<br>
unable to get an online authorisation from us, he may not be able to<br>
authorise your Transaction.<br>
2.5 We may refuse to authorise any use of your Card which would or<br>
could breach these terms and conditions or if we have reasonable<br>
grounds for suspecting that you or a third party have committed or are<br>
planning to commit fraud or any other offence with the use of, or in<br>
connection with, your Card.<br>
2.6 A Transaction Fee is payable in respect of each Transaction.<br>
2.7 You may gift the Card to another person subject to providing him with<br>
a copy of these terms and conditions (which will then bind both you<br>
and the person to whom you have gifted the Card) and subject to the<br>
Card then being used only by that person.<br>
3. Special use of your Card<br>
3.1 In some circumstances we or Merchants may require you to have<br>
Available Funds in excess of the Transaction amount. For instance, at<br>
restaurants you may be required to have 20% more on your Card than<br>
the value of the bill to allow for any service charge added by the<br>
restaurant.<br>
3.2 In some circumstances Merchants may require verification that your<br>
Available Funds will cover the Transaction amount and initiate a hold<br>
on your Available Funds in that amount.<br>
3.3 You will not be able to use your Card at “pay-at-pump” petrol pumps.<br>
However, you will normally be able to use your Card to pay for petrol<br>
by presenting the Card to the kiosk or to a service station attendant.<br>
3.4 If you have registered with us and notified us that you are under 18,<br>
we will endeavour to prevent the Card being used for Transactions<br>
involving certain unsuitable categories of goods or services.<br>
4. Activating your Card and Accessing your Account Details<br>
4.1 You should make a record of your Card number immediately upon<br>
receipt, in case you lose it subsequently.<br>
4.2 The user of the Card must sign the signature strip on the Card<br>
immediately when he receives it.<br>
4.3 Before you can use your Card for the first time, you must activate it.<br>
You can do so by calling us on 0800 458 7150 and, when prompted,<br>
you must enter your Card number and the Account Code.<br>
4.4 You will receive an Account Code with your Card. You will need this<br>
Account Code to activate your Card, and to perform the following<br>
functions in relation to your Card or Account:<br>
(a) register your details;<br>
(b) check the amount of Available Funds;<br>
(c) check Transaction details;<br>
(d) transfer your Available Funds to a new Card (see Condition 8.2);<br>
(e) cancel your Card (see Condition 9.1); and<br>
(f) report your Card as lost or stolen.<br>
4.5 In some countries, including the USA, Merchants may ask you to<br>
enter a four digit PIN to complete your Transaction. In such cases, you<br>
should inform the Merchant that no PIN was issued with your Card,<br>
and offer to provide your signature instead (although this may not be<br>
accepted, in which case you cannot use your Card with that<br>
Merchant).<br>
4.6 For security purposes, you should keep your Account Code safe, and<br>
separate from your Card or any record of your Card number. We will<br>
not incur any liability if you fail to do so.<br>
4.7 If you lose or forget your Account Code before you register your Card,<br>
we cannot issue you with a replacement Account Code. You should,<br>
however, continue to be able to use your Card for Transactions with<br>
most Merchants.<br>
5. Registration<br>
5.1 If you want to enter into Transactions over the internet, some<br>
websites require you to enter your name and address. In order for<br>
your Card to work on these websites, you will have to register a user<br>
name and address with us. You can register either free of charge at<br>
www.idtprime.com or by telephoning us on 0870 144 0280. We<br>
will charge a Registration Fee if you register by telephone.<br>
5.2 We will ask you to quote your Card number, your Account Code and<br>
the day, month and year of your birthday in order to register your<br>
details.<br>
5.3 We reserve the right at any time to satisfy ourselves as to your<br>
identity and home address (for example, by requesting relevant<br>
original documents) including for the purposes of preventing fraud<br>
and/or money laundering.<br>
6. Safeguarding your Card<br>
6.1 The Card may only be used by the purchaser of the Card or, where the<br>
Card has been gifted to another person, by that person. You must not<br>
allow any other person to use your Card.<br>
6.2 You must not disclose your Account Code to anyone else. You must<br>
take all reasonable steps to prevent anyone else from learning your<br>
Account Code.<br>
6.3 If you believe that someone else knows your Account Code and has or<br>
may be able to access your Card number, you should contact us<br>
immediately and we will issue you with a new Card, loaded with your<br>
latest Available Funds (less a Card Replacement Fee), and a new<br>
Account Code.<br>
6.4 You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless against any fraudulent<br>
use made of your Card by you or any person authorised by you.<br>
6.5 If you act without reasonable care and this causes losses, you will<br>
normally be responsible for such losses.<br>
6.6 Once the Available Funds have been spent or the Card has expired or<br>
if it is found after you have reported it as lost or stolen, you should<br>
destroy the Card by cutting it in two through the magnetic strip.<br>
7. Keeping you Informed<br>
We will not send you a statement. However, you can check your Available<br>
Funds and Transaction history at any time by calling us on 0870 144 0280 or by<br>
visiting our website www.idtprime.com and supplying your Account Code.<br>
This service is free but all telephone calls are charged at the national calling<br>
rate (if using a BT landline).<br>
8. Transferring to another Card account<br>
If you have registered your Card with us in accordance with Condition 5, you<br>
can transfer your Available Funds (provided they do not exceed £20) from your<br>
Card to a new activated Card that you have purchased, by visiting our website<br>
at www.idtprime.com, provided that the total value of e-money on the new<br>
Card (after transfer) does not exceed £500. We will charge an Available Funds<br>
Transfer Fee for transferring your money.<br>
9. Cancellation of your Card<br>
9.1 If you wish to cancel your Card at any time, you must:<br>
(a) activate your Card and register your details in accordance with<br>
Condition 5 (if you have not already done so)<br>
(b) call our Customer Services on 0870 144 0280 informing them of your<br>
wish to cancel and to claim a refund of monies. (Customer Services<br>
will then suspend all further use of your Card); and<br>
(c) write to us at Customer Services, IDT Financial Services<br>
Limited, PO Box 1374, Gibraltar confirming your request, quoting<br>
your Card number and enclosing a photocopy of your passport (on the<br>
picture page) and a copy of a recent (less than 3 months old) utility<br>
bill bearing your name and address, in each case certified as being a<br>
true copy of the original by a suitable professional (for example<br>
lawyer, accountant, teacher, doctor, police officer, post office official,<br>
chemist, local government officer) providing his own contact details.<br>
9.2 Once we have received all the necessary information from you and all<br>
Transactions and applicable fees and charges have been processed<br>
we will refund to you any Available Funds less any fees and charges<br>
payable to us, provided that:<br>
9.2.1 your Available Funds are greater than the pounds sterling equivalent<br>
of e10 (10 Euros);<br>
9.2.2 we do not have reasonable grounds to believe that you have acted<br>
fraudulently; and<br>
9.2.3 we are not required to withhold your Available Funds by law or<br>
regulation, or at the request of the police, a court or any regulatory<br>
authority.<br>
We will charge a Balance Reclaim Fee.<br>
9.3 If, following reimbursement of your Available Funds, any further<br>
Transactions are found to have been made or charges or fees incurred<br>
using your Card, we will notify you of the amount and you must<br>
immediately repay to us such amount on demand.<br>
9.4 We will transfer the Available Funds, less any deductions referred to<br>
above, to you by cheque or telegraphic transfer (less any bank<br>
charges) to your nominated bank account in your name. We may in<br>
our discretion transfer the Available Funds to you by another payment<br>
method.<br>
10. Expiry of your Card<br>
Your Card has an expiry date printed on it. It is not possible to purchase a Card<br>
less than one year before the expiry date. Your Card will expire on the earlier<br>
of the expiry date and the date on which the Available Funds on your Card<br>
reach £0.00. If your Card expires before your Available Funds are exhausted,<br>
you can contact us on 0870 144 0280 to request a replacement Card, provided<br>
you do so within 90 days of the expiry date and have previously registered<br>
with us. We will then issue you with a replacement Card against payment of a<br>
Card Replacement Fee. Alternatively you can redeem the Available Funds on<br>
your expired Card in accordance with Condition 9, provided you do so within<br>
90 days of the expiry date. You may not use your Card after the expiry date.<br>
11. Ending the Use of your Card<br>
11.1 We may end or suspend, for such period as may reasonably be<br>
required, the use by you of your Card at any time, without prior<br>
notice:<br>
11.1.1 in the event of any fault or failure in the data information processing<br>
system;<br>
11.1.2 if we reasonably believe that you have used or are likely to use your<br>
Card, or allow it to be used, in breach of these terms and conditions<br>
or to commit an offence or that any Available Funds on your Card or<br>
any other Card issued by us to you may be at risk;<br>
11.1.3 where we have serious grounds for doing so.<br>
If we end the use by you of your Card, we will then be able to refund your<br>
Available Funds to you, against proof to our satisfaction of your identity and that<br>
you are the user, unless we are required to withhold the Available Funds by law<br>
or regulation or at the request of the police, a court or any regulatory authority.<br>
11.2 If any Transactions are found to have been made or charges or fees<br>
incurred using your Card after any action has been taken by us under<br>
Condition 11.1, you must immediately repay such amounts to us.<br>
12. Loss or Theft of your Card<br>
12.1 You should treat the e-money on your Card like cash in your wallet<br>
and look after it accordingly. If you lose your Card or it is stolen, you<br>
may not be able to recover the e-money on it, in just the same way as<br>
you would usually not be able to recover cash which you lose or<br>
which is stolen from you.<br>
12.2 If your Card is lost or stolen or if you think someone is using it<br>
without your permission or if your Card is damaged or malfunctions:<br>
12.2.1 you must contact us immediately on 0870 144 0280; your Account<br>
Code or (if you have previously registered) some other identifying<br>
details so that we can be sure we are speaking to you;<br>
12.2.2 you must provide us with your Card number and either your Account<br>
Code or (if you have previously registered) some other identifying<br>
details so that we can be sure we are speaking to you;
