<p>
The Prime Prepaid MasterCard®<br>
Customer Terms and Conditions<br>
PLEASE NOTE – This version of the Terms and Conditions is for information purposes<br>
only, and may have been updated since it was printed. The current version of the Terms<br>
and Conditions may be found on our website at www.idtprime.com Any questions,<br>
Customers should call 0870 144 0280.<br>
1. Your Card<br>
1. Your Card<br>
1.1 Your Card is a prepaid electronic money (“e-money”) payment<br>
card. It is not a credit, charge or debit card.<br>
1.2 When you purchase your Card at a retail store, the retailer will load it with<br>
the amount of e-money that you purchase, subject to the available<br>
denominations as well as a maximum of £150 (or less, if we so require)<br>
and a minimum of £10. When you purchase a card via our website, which<br>
may be found at idtprime.com, the maximum load is £500. The money<br>
loaded onto your Card is then available for you to spend once you<br>
activate your Card.<br>
1.3 You cannot load additional sums onto your Card after you have purchased<br>
your Card (except via balance transfer – see Condition 8), and you must not<br>
attempt to do so. You can, however, purchase more Cards. Also, you may<br>
be able to upgrade your Card to a Prime reloadable card (subject to the<br>
applicable Consumer Terms &amp; Conditions). The Card is not suitable for<br>
recurring payments, direct debits or standing authorisations unless<br>
upgraded to a Prime reloadable card.<br>
1.4 The Available Funds on your Card will not earn any interest.<br>
1.5 As your Card is a prepaid card and not a credit or charge card, you must<br>
ensure that you have sufficient Available Funds on your Card to pay for<br>
each purchase or payment that you make using your Card (including value<br>
added tax and any other taxes, charges and fees that are applicable).<br>
1.6 Your rights and obligations in relation to your Card are as set out in this<br>
Agreement. This Agreement does not give you any rights against<br>
MasterCard International, its affiliates or any third party. By using this<br>
Card you agree to this Agreement.<br>
1.7 The Card remains our property at all times.<br>
1.8 Only persons over 18 years of age are entitled to purchase the<br>
Card. Once purchased, the Card may be given to another person, including<br>
a child between 13 and 18 years of age (but not younger). However,<br>
Transactions by such a child may not be allowed by some Merchants.<br>
2. Use of your Card<br>
2.1 You can use your Card up to the amount of the Available Funds to enter<br>
into Transactions at Merchants displaying the MasterCard acceptance<br>
mark, including Transactions with Merchants over the internet, by phone or<br>
by mail order. If the Available Funds are insufficient to pay for the<br>
Transaction, some Merchants will not permit you to combine use of the<br>
Card with other payment methods, e.g. cheque, cash or another payment<br>
card.<br>
2.2 You cannot use your Card to make cash withdrawals, whether from ATMs,<br>
banks, shops, or otherwise. You will also be unable to use your Card with<br>
some Merchants who provide services which include the remittance of<br>
money or other services involving cash.<br>
2.3 The value of each Transaction and the amount of any fees or charges<br>
payable by you under this Agreement will be deducted from the<br>
Available Funds.<br>
2.4 In order to protect you and us from fraud, Merchants will seek<br>
authorisation before processing any Transaction. If a Merchant is unable<br>
to get an online authorisation from us, he may not be able to authorise<br>
your Transaction.<br>
2.5 We may refuse to authorise any use of your Card which would or could<br>
breach these Consumer Terms &amp; Conditions or if we have reasonable<br>
grounds for suspecting that you or a third party have committed or are<br>
planning to commit fraud or any other offence with the use of, or in<br>
connection with, your Card.<br>
2.6 A Transaction Fee is payable in respect of each Transaction.<br>
2.7 You may gift the Card to another person subject to providing them with a<br>
copy of these Consumer Terms &amp; Conditions and subject to the Card then<br>
being used only by the Donee. For the purposes of this Agreement, you are<br>
deemed to consent to all Transactions that are consented to by the Donee.<br>
If the Donee is an adult, these Consumer Terms &amp; Conditions shall bind<br>
both you and the Donee and shall be interpreted accordingly. You<br>
cannot gift the Card to a child below 13 years of age. You will<br>
remain solely bound under these Consumer Terms &amp; Conditions if the<br>
Donee is a child under the age of 18 on the date of the gifting of the Card.<br>
2.8 You consent to each Transaction made using the Card by following the<br>
instructions provided by the Merchant to authorise the Transaction.<br>
Such consent cannot be withdrawn.<br>
2.9 Funds to cover an authorised Transaction will be paid by us over to the<br>
Merchant Acquirer the next business day after receipt of the relevant<br>
instruction where the Merchant Acquirer is located within the European<br>
Economic Area, otherwise the funds will be paid over as soon as<br>
reasonably practicable (subject to circumstances beyond our control).<br>
2.10 You agree:<br>
(a) to use the Card in accordance with the Consumer<br>
Terms &amp; Conditions; and<br>
(b) to notify us, without any undue delay, on becoming aware of<br>
the loss, theft or misappropriation of the Card, or its<br>
unauthorised use (see Condition 12).<br>
3. Special use of your Card<br>
3.1 In some circumstances we or Merchants may require you to have Available<br>
Funds in excess of the Transaction amount. For instance, at restaurants<br>
you may be required to have 20% more on your Card than the value of the<br>
bill to allow for any service charge added by the restaurant.<br>
3.2 Merchants may require verification that your Available Funds will cover the<br>
Transaction amount and initiate a hold on your Available Funds in that<br>
amount.<br>
3.3 You will not be able to use your Card at “pay-at-pump” petrol pumps.<br>
However, you will normally be able to use your Card to pay for petrol by<br>
presenting the Card at the kiosk or to a service station attendant.<br>
3.4 In countries outside the UK, some Merchants may not accept your Card. It<br>
is your responsibility to check the position with each Merchant. We accept<br>
no liability if a Merchant refuses to accept your Card.<br>
4. Activating your Card and Accessing your Account Details<br>
4.1 You should make a record of your Card number immediately<br>
upon receipt, in case you subsequently lose it.<br>
4.2 The User must sign the signature strip on the Card immediately.<br>
4.3 Before you can use your Card for the first time, you must activate it. You<br>
can do so by calling us on 0800 458 7150 and, when prompted, you must<br>
enter your Card number and the Account Code.<br>
4.4 You will receive an Account Code with your Card. You will need this<br>
Account Code to activate your Card, and to perform the<br>
following functions in relation to your Card or Account:<br>
(a) registering your details;<br>
(b) checking the amount of Available Funds;<br>
(c) checking Transaction details;<br>
(d) transferring your Available Funds to a new Card (see<br>
Condition 8);<br>
(e) cancelling your Card (see Condition 9.1); and<br>
(f) reporting your Card as lost or stolen (see Condition 12).<br>
Please note that the Account Code is not a personal identification number<br>
(“PIN”) to be used for ATMs.<br>
4.5 In some countries, including the USA, Merchants may ask you to enter a<br>
four digit PIN to complete your Transaction. In such cases, you should<br>
inform the Merchant that no PIN was issued with your Card, and offer to<br>
provide your signature instead (although this may not be accepted, in<br>
which case you cannot use your Card with that Merchant).<br>
4.6 For security purposes, you should keep your Account Code safe, and<br>
separate from your Card or any record of your Card number. We will not<br>
incur any liability if you fail to do so.<br>
4.7 If you lose or forget your Account Code before you register your Card, we<br>
cannot issue you with a replacement Account Code. You should, however,<br>
continue to be able to use your Card for Transactions with most Merchants.<br>
4.8 You may request that we send you a copy of the current Consumer Terms &amp;<br>
Conditions.<br>
5. Registration<br>
5.1 It is necessary for you to register your Card so that we may provide you<br>
with information you are entitled to by law. Furthermore, if you want to<br>
enter into Transactions over the internet, some websites require you to<br>
enter your name and address; and in order for your Card to work on these<br>
websites, you will have to register your name and address with us. You<br>
can register either free of charge at idtprime.com or by telephoning us on<br>
0870 144 0280. We will charge a Registration Fee if you register by<br>
telephone.<br>
5.2 We will ask you to quote your Card number, your Account Code and the<br>
day, month and year of your birthday in order to register your details.<br>
5.3 We reserve the right at any time to satisfy ourselves as to your identity<br>
and home address for the purposes of preventing fraud and/or<br>
money laundering by requiring you to provide us with information (for<br>
example, by requesting relevant original documents). We may also conduct<br>
electronic searches regarding your identity and home address, these<br>
searches may result in a search footprint which could be accessed by<br>
other financial institutions.<br>
6. Safeguarding your Card<br>
6.1 The Card may only be used by the purchaser of the Card or, where the Card<br>
has been gifted to another person, by that person. You must not allow any<br>
other person to use your Card.<br>
6.2 You must not disclose your Account Code to anyone else. You must take<br>
all reasonable steps to prevent anyone else from learning your Account<br>
Code.<br>
6.3 If you believe that someone else knows your Account Code and has or may<br>
be able to access your Card number, you should contact us immediately on<br>
0870 144 0280 and we will issue you with a new Card, loaded with your<br>
latest Available Funds (less a Card Replacement Fee), and a new Account<br>
Code.<br>
6.4 You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless against any fraudulent use<br>
made of your Card by you or any person authorised by you.<br>
6.5 If you act fraudulently and this causes losses, you will normally<br>
be responsible for such losses.<br>
6.6 Once the Available Funds have been spent or the Card has expired or if it<br>
is found after you have reported it as lost or stolen, you should destroy the<br>
Card by cutting it in two through the magnetic strip.<br>
7. Keeping you Informed<br>
We will not send you a statement. However, you can check your Available Funds<br>
and Transaction history at any time by visiting our website at idtprime.com or<br>
calling us on 0870 144 0280, and entering your Account Code. This service is<br>
free but all telephone calls are charged at the national calling rate (if using<br>
a BT landline).<br>
8. Transferring to Another Card Account<br>
If you have registered your Card with us in accordance with Condition 5, you can<br>
transfer your Available Funds (provided they do not exceed £20) from your Card to<br>
a new activated Card that you have purchased, by visiting our website at<br>
idtprime.com, provided that the total cumulative value of e-money loaded on the<br>
new Card using this type of transfer does not exceed £500. We will charge an<br>
Available Funds Transfer Fee for transferring your money.<br>
9. Redemption and Cancelation<br>
9.1 Cancellation<br>
9.1.1 If you wish to cancel your Card and Account at any time, you must return<br>
your Card(s) cut in half through the magnetic strip to Customer Services,<br>
IDT Financial Services Limited, PO Box 1374, Gibraltar. For the avoidance<br>
of doubt, Condition 9.2 as amended by Condition 9.1.2 applies when you<br>
cancel your Card and Account. Therefore you must also comply with<br>
requirements of Condition 9.2.1 if you wish to redeem any of the funds on<br>
your Account.<br>
9.1.2 We do not charge a cancellation fee if you cancel the Card and Account<br>
after 12 months from the date you purchased the Card (or otherwise<br>
acquired the Card) and you redeem funds from your Card. In such<br>
circumstances we do not charge a Redemption Fee but we will deduct an<br>
ID Document Processing Fee for processing your identification documents<br>
(as specified in Condition 9.2.1(c)). In all other circumstances we will<br>
charge a Redemption Fee and an ID Document Processing Fee.<br>
9.1.3 This Agreement will terminate 90 days after the Card and Account are<br>
cancelled. The value (e-money) on your Account will no longer be valid<br>
once 90 days have elapsed after the cancellation and you will no longer be<br>
able to redeem any unused value remaining on the Account.<br>
9.1.4 If, following cancellation of your Card and Account, any further<br>
Transactions are found to have been made, or charges or fees incurred<br>
using your Card, we will:<br>
(a) deduct these from your Available Funds (if any); or<br>
(b) notify you of the amount and you must immediately<br>
repay to us the amount on demand.<br>
9.2 Redemption<br>
9.2.1 If you wish to redeem money from your Card and Account at any time<br>
(including after the cancellation or expiry of your Card and Account), you<br>
must:<br>
(a) register your details in accordance with Condition 5 (if<br>
you have not already done so);<br>
(b) call our Customer Services on 0870 144 0280 informing<br>
them of your wish to redeem money from your Card and<br>
Account; and<br>
(c) write to us at Customer Services, IDT Financial Services<br>
Limited, PO Box 1374, Gibraltar confirming your request, quoting<br>
your Card number and enclosing a photocopy of your passport (i.e.<br>
the picture page) and a copy of a recent (less than 3 months old)<br>
utility bill bearing your name and address, in each case certified as<br>
being a true copy of the original by a suitable professional (for<br>
example, lawyer, accountant, teacher, doctor, police officer, post<br>
office official, chemist, local government officer) providing his own<br>
contact details.<br>
9.2.2 Once we have received all the necessary information from you and all<br>
Transactions and applicable fees and charges have been processed, we<br>
will provide you with the requested amount of funds (“Requested Funds”)<br>
less any fees and charges payable to us, provided that:<br>
(a) the Requested Funds are greater than the Pound<br>
Sterling equivalent of €10 (10 Euros);<br>
(b) we do not have reasonable grounds to believe that you<br>
have acted fraudulently; and<br>
(c) we are not required to withhold your Available Funds<br>
by law or regulation, or at the request of the police, a<br>
court or any regulatory authority.<br>
9.2.3 We will transfer the Requested Funds, less any deductions referred to<br>
above, to you by bank transfer (less any bank charges) to your nominated<br>
UK bank account in your name. We may in our discretion transfer the<br>
Requested Funds to you by another payment method. We will charge a<br>
Redemption Fee and an ID Document Processing Fee.<br>
9.2.4 If, following a redemption of funds, Transactions are found to have been<br>
made, or charges or fees incurred using your Card that exceed your<br>
Available Funds, we will notify you of the amount of the difference and you<br>
must immediately repay to us the amount on demand.<br>
10. Expiry of your Card<br>
10.1 Your Card has an expiry date printed on it. It is not possible to<br>
purchase a Card less than one year before the expiry date. Your Card will<br>
expire on the earlier of the expiry date and the date on which the Available<br>
Funds on your Card reach £0.00. If your Card expires before your Available<br>
Funds are exhausted, you can contact us on 0870 144 0280 to request a<br>
replacement Card, provided you do so within 90 days of the expiry date and<br>
have previously registered with us. We will then issue you with a<br>
replacement Card against payment of a Card Replacement Fee.<br>
Alternatively, you can redeem the Available Funds on your expired Card in<br>
accordance with Condition 9, provided you do so within 90 days<br>
of the expiry date. You may not use your Card after the expiry date.<br>
10.2 The value (e-money) on your Account will no longer be valid once 90 days<br>
have elapsed after the expiry date shown on your Card. If you fail to<br>
request a replacement Card and fail to redeem the Available Funds within<br>
90 days of the expiry date, you will no longer be able to redeem or use any<br>
unused value remaining on the Account.<br>
10.3 This Agreement will terminate 90 days after the expiry of the Card.<br>
10.4 We may terminate this Agreement without notice. Any such termination<br>
will cause the Card to expire and you can redeem any Available Funds in<br>
accordance with Condition 9. We will not charge you a Redemption Fee<br>
but we will deduct an ID Document Processing Fee.<br>
10.5 All obligations and duties that either expressly or by their nature extend<br>
beyond the termination of this Agreement will continue to be in force after<br>
the termination of this Agreement.<br>
11. Blocking your Card and Refusing Transactions<br>
11.1 We may block, for such period as may reasonably be required, the use of<br>
the Card at any time:<br>
(a) for objectively justified reasons related to the<br>
security of the Card; or<br>
(b) if we suspect the unauthorised or fraudulent use of<br>
the Card.<br>
11.2 We will inform you of the blocking of the Card and the reasons for the<br>
blocking where possible in advance and at the latest immediately after<br>
except (i) when prohibited by law, or (ii) for objectively justified security<br>
reasons.<br>
11.3 We will either unblock the Card or replace it with a new Card loaded with<br>
an amount equivalent to your last Available Funds once the conditions for<br>
blocking the Card no longer exist. We may charge for a replacement Card<br>
if we believe you have acted negligently.<br>
11.4 We may refuse any Transaction if we suspect the Transaction:<br>
(a) is unauthorised or fraudulent; or<br>
(b) will result in any other breach of the Consumer<br>
Terms &amp; Conditions.<br>
11.5 Except where Condition 11.7 applies, we will notify you of such<br>
a refusal, if possible the reason for the refusal, and where relevant the<br>
procedure for rectifying any factual error that led to the refusal. We will<br>
make no notification of refusal (i) if we are prohibited by law or (ii) where<br>
there are objectively justified security reasons for doing so.<br>
11.6 We may charge you a Transaction Fee for any refused Transaction that<br>
you authorised.<br>
11.7 For the avoidance of doubt, we will refuse a Transaction if you have<br>
insufficient Available Funds. The refusal of such a Transaction will be our<br>
