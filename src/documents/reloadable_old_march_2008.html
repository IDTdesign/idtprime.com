<p>
CUSTOMER TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS<br>
PRIME RELOADABLE CARDS<br>
Please note: The current version of<br>
the Terms and Conditions appears at<br>
www.idtprime.com/reloadable-terms.aspx on the<br>
Prime Card Website. The version set out below<br>
(dated March 2008), is for illustrative purposes only,<br>
and may be out of date.<br>
1. Your Card<br>
1.1 Your Card is a prepaid electronic money (e-money) payment card.<br>
It is not a credit card.<br>
1.2 You may Reload your Account with value (e-money) either at any<br>
designated outlet, upon presentation of your Card, or (once the<br>
service is available) via our website www.idtprime.com .<br>
A Reloading Fee applies. See our website or call Customer<br>
Services on 0870 144 0280 for current information on designated<br>
outlets and other information concerning Reloading your Account.<br>
It is your responsibility to ensure that you Reload the correct<br>
Account. When you Reload at an outlet, you should request and<br>
keep the receipt which confirms the Reload.<br>
1.3 Unless we inform you otherwise (for example, if you only qualify for<br>
a Card with lower limits), you may Reload your Account up to 2<br>
times daily with a minimum per Reload of £10 and a maximum per<br>
Reload which depends on the method of Reload but will not exceed<br>
£2500, provided that the balance on your Account never exceeds<br>
£5,000 and the total Reloaded on your Account in a calendar year<br>
does not exceed £25,000. We reserve the right to vary these limits<br>
and to decline any Reload at any time and will notify you as soon<br>
as is reasonably practical in the circumstances.<br>
1.4 The Available Funds on your Account will not earn any interest.<br>
1.5 As your Card is a prepaid card and not a credit card, you must<br>
ensure that you have sufficient Available Funds loaded on your<br>
Account to pay for each purchase, payment or cash withdrawal<br>
that you make using your Card (including value added tax and any<br>
other taxes, charges and fees that are applicable). If for any<br>
reason a Transaction is processed with your Card where the<br>
Transaction amount exceeds the Available Funds on your Account,<br>
you (the Primary Registered Person) must repay us the amount of<br>
such excess immediately.<br>
1.6 Your rights and obligations in relation to your Card and Account<br>
are as set out in this Agreement. This Agreement does not give you<br>
any rights against MasterCard International, its affiliates or any<br>
third party.<br>
1.7 The Card remains our property at all times.<br>
1.8 Only persons over 18 years of age are entitled to register for an<br>
upgraded Account. However, if you are the Primary Registered<br>
Person you may allow the Card and Account to be accessed by<br>
your own child (or a child of whom you are the legal guardian) who<br>
is between 13 and 18 years of age in accordance with Condition 2.7<br>
or 2.8. However, Transactions by persons under 18 years of age<br>
may not be allowed by some Merchants.<br>
2. Use of your Card<br>
2.1 You can use your Card up to the amount of the Available Funds to<br>
enter into Transactions at Merchants displaying the MasterCard<br>
acceptance mark, including Transactions with Merchants over the<br>
internet, by phone or mail order. If the Available Funds are<br>
insufficient to pay for the Transaction, some Merchants will not<br>
permit you to combine use of the Card with other payment<br>
methods, e.g. cheque, cash or another payment card.<br>
2.2 If you have been issued with a New Card, it can be used to make<br>
cash withdrawals from ATMs and banks who agree to provide this<br>
service, up to a total of £500 per day (subject to any maximum set<br>
by the relevant ATM operator or bank), unless we inform you<br>
otherwise. You will not be able to use your Original Card in this way<br>
unless your Original Card permits cash withdrawals.<br>
2.3 The value of each Transaction and the amount of any fees or<br>
charges payable by you under this Agreement will be deducted<br>
from the Available Funds.<br>
2.4 In order to protect you and us from fraud, Merchants and ATM<br>
operators will seek authorisation before processing any<br>
Transaction. If a Merchant or ATM operator is unable to get an<br>
online authorisation from us, he may not be able to authorise<br>
your Transaction.<br>
2.5 We may refuse to authorise any use of your Card which would or<br>
could breach these terms and conditions or if we have reasonable<br>
grounds for suspecting that you or a third party have committed or<br>
are planning to commit fraud or any other offence with the use of,<br>
or in connection with, your Card or Account.<br>
2.6 (i) A Transaction Fee is payable in respect of each Transaction<br>
(other than a cash withdrawal).<br>
(ii) A Cash Withdrawal Fee is payable in respect of cash<br>
withdrawals made using your Card. Your withdrawal may also<br>
be subject to any applicable fees, rules and regulations of the<br>
relevant ATM operator or bank. It is your responsibility to<br>
check whether any such additional fees apply, as they cannot<br>
be refunded once the cash has been withdrawn.<br>
2.7 If you are the Primary Registered Person, you may allow your<br>
Original Card and Account to be operated by your own child (or a<br>
child of whom you are the legal guardian) who is between 13 and<br>
18 years of age provided you have previously successfully<br>
registered his details with us, and subject to you providing him with<br>
a copy of these terms and conditions (which will then bind both of<br>
you) and the Card then being used only by that child. You will not<br>
be able to register your child’s details for this purpose if you have<br>
already been sent a New Card. You (the Primary Registered<br>
Person) will remain responsible for the use of the Card and the<br>
Account, and for any fees and charges incurred by your child, and<br>
you will continue to be regarded as the holder of any e-money<br>
already or subsequently loaded on the Account.<br>
2.8 If you are the Primary Registered Person, you may apply to us to<br>
have a Second Cardholder registered for your Account. If you<br>
successfully register, we will send you a New Card, for which we<br>
will charge a New Card Fee. Upon receipt of the New Card, you<br>
may give the New Card to the Second Cardholder for his use,<br>
subject to (i) you providing him with a copy of these terms and<br>
conditions (which will then bind both of you) (ii) the New Card then<br>
being used only by that person (iii) you retaining the other Card and<br>
(iv) you informing the Second Cardholder that you have retained<br>
the other Card and that you are still able to use the Account. You<br>
(the Primary Registered Person) will remain responsible for the use<br>
of the Cards and the Account, and for any fees and charges<br>
incurred by the Second Cardholder, and you will continue to be<br>
regarded as the holder of any e-money already or subsequently<br>
loaded on the Account. The use of a Card in relation to which a<br>
Second Cardholder has been registered will be regarded as<br>
confirmation that you have provided the Second Cardholder with<br>
these Terms and Conditions and he has accepted them. Children<br>
under 18 may not be registered as a Second Cardholder, unless<br>
they are over 13 and you (the Primary Registered Person) are the<br>
child’s parent or legal guardian.<br>
2.9 If you have been issued with a New Card, then (unless you have<br>
successfully registered a Second Cardholder in accordance with<br>
Condition 2.8) you must destroy your Original Card immediately,<br>
unless we inform you otherwise.<br>
2.10 Your ability to use or access your Card and Account may<br>
occasionally be interrupted, for example if we need to carry out<br>
maintenance on our systems. Please call Customer Services on<br>
0870 144 0280 to notify us of any problems you are experiencing<br>
using your Card and we will use reasonable endeavours to deal<br>
with the problem.<br>
3. Special use of your Card<br>
3.1 In some circumstances we or Merchants may require you to have<br>
Available Funds in excess of the Transaction amount. For instance,<br>
at restaurants you may be required to have 20% more on your Card<br>
than the value of the bill to allow for any service charge added by<br>
the restaurant.<br>
3.2 In some circumstances Merchants may require verification that<br>
your Available Funds will cover the Transaction amount and initiate<br>
a hold on your Available Funds in that amount.<br>
3.3 You will not be able to use your Card at “pay-at-pump” petrol<br>
pumps. However, you will normally be able to use your Card to pay<br>
for petrol by presenting the Card to the kiosk or to a service station<br>
attendant.<br>
3.4 If you have indicated to us that you will be giving a Card to your<br>
child who is under 18, we will endeavour (at your request) to<br>
prevent the Card and Account being used for Transactions<br>
involving certain unsuitable categories of goods or services.<br>
3.5 Some Merchants may not accept your Card. It is your responsibility<br>
to check the position with each Merchant. We accept no liability if<br>
a Merchant refuses to accept your Card.<br>
4. Card Details, PIN and Accessing your<br>
Account Details<br>
4.1 You should keep a record of your Card number, in case you lose it.<br>
4.2 The user of the Card must sign the signature strip on the Card<br>
immediately when received. In the case of cards which you are<br>
allowing your child to use and Second Cardholders, you must<br>
ensure that you do not sign a Card unless you are the intended user.<br>
4.3 If your Card permits cash withdrawals (see Condition 2.2), we will<br>
provide the Primary Registered Person by post or email with a<br>
Personal Identification Number (PIN) for use with your Card. You<br>
will need this PIN in order to make cash withdrawals from an ATM<br>
or at a Bank. If you forget your PIN, you should call Customer<br>
Services for a replacement PIN, which will be sent out to the<br>
Primary Registered Person.<br>
4.4 You (the Primary Registered Person) will also have received an<br>
Account Code with your Original Card. You will need this Account<br>
Code to perform the following functions in relation to your Card or<br>
Account (except in some cases where functions (a), (b), (c) and (d)<br>
are performed via Customer Services):<br>
(a) changing your registered details;<br>
(b) checking the amount of Available Funds;<br>
(c) checking Transaction details;<br>
(d) transferring your Available Funds to a new card account<br>
(see Condition 8);<br>
(e) reporting your Card as lost or stolen.<br>
(f) Requesting SMS Text Balance Services<br>
(g) Changing your Account Code<br>
4.5 For security purposes, you must keep your Account Code safe, and<br>
separate from your Card or any record of your Card number. Failure<br>
to do so will be treated as gross negligence and will affect your<br>
ability to claim any losses.<br>
5. Registered Information and Customer<br>
Identification<br>
5.1 If you enter into Transactions over the internet, some websites<br>
require you to enter your name and address. In such cases you<br>
should supply the most recent address which has been registered<br>
with us by the Primary Registered Person as the Account address.<br>
5.2 The Account address is also the address to which we will send<br>
any correspondence, and must always be a UK address.<br>
5.3 You (the Primary Registered Person) must notify us within 7 days of<br>
any change in the Account address or your other contact details.<br>
You can notify us by contacting Customer Services, who may<br>
require you to confirm such notification in writing. You will be<br>
liable for any loss or fraud that directly results from any failure to<br>
notify us of such a change. We may need to verify your new<br>
Account address.<br>
5.4 We reserve the right at any time to satisfy ourselves as to your<br>
identity and home address (for example, by requesting relevant<br>
original documents) including for the purposes of preventing fraud<br>
and/or money laundering.<br>
6. Safeguarding your Card<br>
6.1 The Card and Account may only be used by the Primary Registered<br>
Person or, where a Card has (in accordance with these terms and<br>
conditions) been either<br>
(i) passed to your child to use or (ii) given to a person for use as a<br>
second cardholder, by that person. You must not give the Card to<br>
any other person or allow any other person to use the Card or<br>
Account. You must keep the Card in a safe place, and not use the<br>
Card on a website in circumstances where the website’s security<br>
is in doubt.<br>
6.2 You must keep your PIN safe at all times. This includes:<br>
(i) memorising your PIN as soon as you receive it, and<br>
destroying the letter or email in which it was sent to you<br>
immediately. If you need to write down your PIN in order to<br>
help you remember it, you must make sure it is well disguised<br>
(ii) never writing your PIN on your Card or on anything you<br>
usually keep with your Card<br>
(iii) keeping you PIN secret at all times (and ensuring that any<br>
Second Cardholder does the same), including by not using<br>
your PIN if anyone else is watching<br>
(iv) not disclosing your PIN to any person, except that you may<br>
disclose the PIN orally (but not in writing) to a person<br>
authorised (by Conditions 2.7 or 2.8 of these terms and<br>
conditions) to use your Card or Account.<br>
NEVER COMMUNICATE YOUR PIN TO ANYONE IN A WRITTEN<br>
FORM. Failure to comply with this condition 6.2 will be treated as<br>
gross negligence and will affect your ability to claim any losses.<br>
6.3 You must not disclose your Account Code to anyone else. You must<br>
take all reasonable steps to prevent anyone else from learning<br>
your Account Code. If you believe that someone else knows your<br>
Account Code, you should contact us immediately in order to<br>
change your Account Code.<br>
6.4 If you suspect that someone who is not authorised to use your<br>
Card or Account knows your PIN, you should contact us<br>
immediately and we will issue the Primary Registered Person with<br>
a new PIN.<br>
6.5 You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless against any<br>
fraudulent use made of your Card or Account by you or any person<br>
authorised by you.<br>
6.6 If you act without reasonable care and this causes losses, you will<br>
normally be responsible for such losses.<br>
6.7 Once your Card has expired or if it is found after you have reported<br>
it as lost or stolen (or– if there is a Second Cardholder – in any<br>
case where the Account’s other Card has been reported as lost or<br>
stolen) you should destroy your Card by cutting it in two through<br>
the magnetic strip.<br>
7. Keeping you Informed<br>
7.1 We will not send you a statement. However, you (the Primary<br>
Registered Person) can check your Available Funds and<br>
Transaction history at any time by calling us on 0870 144 0280 or by<br>
visiting our website www.idtprime.com and supplying your<br>
Account Code. This service is free but all telephone calls are<br>
charged at the national calling rate (if using a BT landline).<br>
7.2 We also offer an optional SMS Text Balance Service, which allows<br>
you to receive an SMS text showing your current balance every<br>
evening, provided at least one Transaction or reload has taken<br>
place in relation to your Account during the previous 24 hours.<br>
You can register for this service on our website<br>
www.idtprime.com. If you choose to register for this service, a<br>
monthly SMS Text Balance Fee will be deducted from your funds at<br>
the beginning of each month for the duration of the period for<br>
which you remain registered for this service.<br>
8. Transferring to Another Card Account<br>
You may be able to transfer your Available Funds (provided they do<br>
not exceed £20) from your Account to the account of a new<br>
activated Prime card that you have purchased, by visiting our<br>
website at www.idtprime.com, provided that the total cumulative<br>
value of e-money loaded on the new card account (after transfer)<br>
does not exceed £500 (unless we inform you otherwise).<br>
We will charge an Available Funds Transfer Fee for transferring<br>
your e-money.<br>
9. Cancellation of your Card(s) and Account<br>
9.1 If you are the Primary Registered Person and you wish to cancel<br>
the Card(s) and Account at any time, you must call Customer<br>
Services on 0870 144 0280 informing them of your wish to cancel<br>
and to claim a refund of monies (Customer Services will then<br>
suspend all further use of your Card(s) and Account).<br>
9.2 Once we have received all the necessary information from you and<br>
all Transactions and applicable fees and charges have been<br>
processed we will refund to you (the Primary Registered Person)<br>
any Available Funds less any fees and charges payable to us,<br>
provided that:<br>
(a) your Available Funds are greater than the pounds sterling<br>
equivalent of €10 (10 Euros);<br>
(b) we do not have reasonable grounds to believe that you have<br>
acted fraudulently; and<br>
(c) we are not required to withhold your Available Funds by law<br>
or regulation, or at the request of the police, a court or any<br>
regulatory authority.<br>
We will charge a Balance Reclaim Fee. Once your Card(s) and<br>
Account have been cancelled, it will be your responsibility to<br>
destroy your Card(s).<br>
9.3 If, following reimbursement of your Available Funds, any further<br>
Transactions are found to have been made or charges or fees<br>
incurred using the Card(s), we will notify you (the Primary<br>
Registered Person) of the amount and you must immediately repay<br>
to us such amount on demand.<br>
9.4 We will transfer the Available Funds, less any deductions referred<br>
to above, to you (the Primary Registered Person) by cheque or<br>
telegraphic transfer (less any bank charges) to your nominated<br>
bank account in your name. We may in our discretion transfer the<br>
Available Funds to you by another payment method.<br>
9.5 Your right to withdraw<br>
(a) You (the Primary Registered Person) have a period of 14 days<br>
beginning on the date of the successful registration of your<br>
Account to become Reloadable, to withdraw from this<br>
agreement and cancel the Card(s) and Account, without any<br>
penalty or charge. You must contact us within this 14 day<br>
period and inform us that you wish to withdraw from this<br>
Agreement. If so, we will cancel the Card(s) and Account and<br>
reimburse the amount of Available Funds on the Account to<br>
you (the Primary Registered Person). However, we reserve<br>
the right to hold available funds for up to 20 business days<br>
from receipt of your instructions before returning the balance,<br>
to ensure that details of all transactions have been received.<br>
(b) After this 14 day period, you may only cancel the Card(s) and<br>
Account as described in Conditions 9.1 to 9.4 above.<br>
10. Expiry of your Card and Funds on the Account<br>
10.1 Your Card has an expiry date printed on it. This date will always be<br>
at least one year after the date on which the Original Card was<br>
purchased. Your Card will expire on the expiry date. If a Card<br>
expires before your Available Funds are exhausted, you (the<br>
Primary Registered Person) can contact us on 0870 144 0280 to<br>
request a replacement Card, provided you do so within 90 days of<br>
the expiry date (or by the date 12 months after the most recent<br>
loading of funds on the Account which took place prior to the<br>
expiry date, if this is later). We will then issue you with a<br>
replacement Card against payment of a Card Replacement Fee (NB<br>
we can also issue a replacement Card for a Second Cardholder).<br>
Alternatively you (the Primary Registered Person) can redeem the<br>
Available Funds on the expired Card in accordance with Condition<br>
9, provided you do so within 90 days of the expiry date (or by the<br>
date 12 months after the most recent loading of funds on the<br>
Account which took place prior to the expiry date, if this is later).<br>
You may not use your Card(s) after the expiry date.<br>
Reload_Ts&amp;Cs_v2.1:ts&amp;cs 19/3/08 09:34 Page 1<br>
10.2 The value (e-money) on your Account will no longer be valid once<br>
90 days have elapsed after the expiry date shown on your Card,<br>
and 12 months have passed since the most recent loading of funds<br>
on your Account. If you fail to request a replacement Card and fail<br>
to redeem the Available funds within 90 days of the expiry date (or<br>
by the date 12 months after the most recent loading of funds on the<br>
Account which took place prior to the expiry date, if this is later),<br>
you will no longer be able to redeem or use any unused value<br>
remaining on the Account.<br>
10.3 We reserve the right to issue you with a replacement for an<br>
expired Card even if you have not requested one. If we do so,<br>
Condition 10.2 will not apply. If you have not requested a<br>
replacement Card, you will not be charged a Card<br>
Replacement Fee.<br>
11. Ending the Use of your Card and Account<br>
11.1 We may end or suspend, for such period as may reasonably be<br>
required, the use by you of your Card and Account at any time,<br>
without prior notice:<br>
(a) in the event of any fault or failure in the data information<br>
processing system;<br>
(b) if we reasonably believe that you have used or are likely to<br>
use your Card or Account, or allow them to be used, in breach<br>
of these terms and conditions or to commit an offence or that<br>
any Available Funds on your Account or the account of any<br>
other Card issued by us to you may be at risk;<br>
(c) if we suspect that you or a Second Cardholder have provided<br>
false information<br>
(d) where we have serious grounds for doing so.<br>
If we end the use by you of your Card and Account, we will then be<br>
able to refund your Available Funds to you (the Primary Registered<br>
Person), against proof to our satisfaction of your identity, unless<br>
we are required to withhold the Available Funds by law or<br>
regulation or at the request of the police, a court or any<br>
regulatory authority.<br>
11.2 If any Transactions are found to have been made or charges or<br>
fees incurred using your Card after any action has been taken by<br>
us under Condition 11.1, you (the Primary Registered Person) must<br>
immediately repay such amounts to us.<br>
12. Loss or Theft of your Card<br>
12.1 You should treat your Card like cash in your wallet and look after it<br>
accordingly. If you lose your Card or it is stolen, you may not be<br>
able to recover the funds (e-money) on your Account, in just the<br>
same way as you would usually not be able to recover cash which<br>
you lose or which is stolen from you.<br>
12.2 If your Card is lost or stolen or if you think someone is using your<br>
Card or your Account without your permission or if your Card is<br>
damaged or malfunctions:<br>
(a) you must contact us immediately on 0870 144 0280;<br>
(b) you must provide us with your Card number and either your<br>
Account Code or some other identifying details acceptable to<br>
us so that we can be sure we are speaking to you;<br>
(c) provided we have obtained the Primary Registered Person’s<br>
consent to close the Account, we will then provide the Primary<br>
Registered Person with a new Card with a corresponding new<br>
Account loaded with an amount equivalent to your last<br>
Available Funds, unless we are required to withhold your<br>
Available Funds by law or regulation or at the request of the<br>
police, a court or any regulatory authority.<br>
12.3 You (the Primary Registered Person) will be liable for any<br>
Transactions that take place prior to your notifying us (whether or<br>
not they were made with your permission) and these will reduce<br>
the Available Funds on your Account. Once we have been notified<br>
of the loss or theft, we will suspend the Card(s) and Account as<br>
soon as we are able, to limit any further losses. We can only take<br>
steps to prevent unauthorised use of the Card(s) and Account if<br>
you can provide us with the Card number and Account Code or if<br>
you can produce sufficient details to identify yourself and the<br>
relevant Account.<br>
12.4 If we decide to refund any Available Funds to you (the Primary<br>
Registered Person), this will be paid to you in accordance with<br>
Condition 9.4. We will charge you a Balance Reclaim Fee.<br>
12.5 Replacement Cards will be posted to the most recent Account<br>
address registered by the Primary Registered Person. A Card<br>
Replacement Fee will be charged.<br>
12.6 If you subsequently find or retrieve a Card that you have reported<br>
lost or stolen, you must immediately notify us on 0870 144 0280.<br>
12.7 You agree to help us, our agents and the police if your Card is lost,<br>
stolen or if we suspect that the Card or Account is being misused.<br>
13. Fees and Charges<br>
13.1 Our fees and charges are set out in the Table below and are<br>
variable (see Condition 18.1).<br>
13.2 Your Account is subject to a monthly Account Dormancy Fee in<br>
relation to any period of at least three months during which no<br>
Transaction takes place. Such fee will automatically be deducted<br>
from the Available Funds after the first three months of such period<br>
have passed, and then monthly for as long as no Transaction takes<br>
place.<br>
13.3 We will charge a Cash Withdrawal Fee for each cash withdrawal.<br>
Please note that in some cases, the operator of an ATM may<br>
charge its own fee for the use of the ATM, which fee will also be<br>
deducted from the Available Funds.<br>
13.4 We will charge a Transaction Fee for each Transaction (other than<br>
cash withdrawals).<br>
13.5 If you use your Card for Transactions in a currency other than<br>
Pounds Sterling (£), the amount deducted from your Available<br>
Funds will be the Transaction Amount converted to Pounds Sterling<br>
using a rate set by MasterCard on the day we receive details of<br>
that Transaction. You will also be charged a Foreign<br>
Exchange Charge.<br>
13.6 We will deduct any value added tax, and other taxes, charges and<br>
fees due by you to us from the Available Funds. If there are no<br>
Available Funds, or value added tax and other taxes, charges and<br>
fees incurred exceed the Available Funds, you must pay us the<br>
excess immediately.<br>

(whether arising in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of<br>
statutory duty or otherwise) shall be subject to the following<br>
exclusions and limitations:<br>

be limited to replacement of the Card or, at our choice,<br>
repayment to you of the Available Funds;<br>
(g) Where sums are incorrectly deducted from your Available<br>
Funds due to our default, our liability shall be limited to<br>

death or personal injury.<br>

the Available Funds on your Account may lose their value and<br>
become unusable, and accordingly you may lose any e-money<br>
loaded onto your Account.<br>
15. Disputes<br>
15.1 If you (the Primary Registered Person) believe that a deduction has<br>
been made from your Available Funds by mistake, you should<br>
contact us on 0870 144 0280 immediately and in any event within 30<br>
days of the relevant Transaction or deduction. You must then<br>
confirm the disputed Transaction by writing to Customer Services<br>

Transaction and your reason for disputing it. Provided you are able<br>

terms and conditions, in particular keeping your Card, Account<br>
Code and PIN number (if you have been provided with one) safe.<br>

believe that you have not acted in accordance with these terms<br>
and conditions.<br>
15.3 You must provide us with all receipts and information that are<br>
relevant to your claim.<br>

money from your Available Funds, we shall refund the amount to<br>
your Card Account. Refunds below £50 are at our sole discretion.<br>
Until our investigation is complete the disputed amount will be<br>
unavailable to spend. If we subsequently establish that the<br>
refunded amount had been correctly deducted, we may deduct it<br>
from your Available Funds. If you do not have sufficient Available<br>
Funds, you must repay us the amount immediately.<br>
15.5 We reserve the right to charge you an Investigation Fee for<br>
investigating your claim.<br>
15.6 If there is an un-resolvable dispute in circumstances where the<br>
Card has been used for a Transaction, you will be liable for the<br>
Transaction and will have to resolve this directly with the<br>
relevant Merchant.<br>
