<p>
[NEW] IDT Prime Higher Limit Reloadable Consumer Terms &amp; Conditions Jan 2011 1. Your Card 1.1 Your Card is a prepaid electronic money (“e-money”) payment card. It is not a credit card. 1.2 You may reload your Account with value (e-money) at any designated outlet, upon presentation of your Card. Depending on the method of Reload, a Reloading Fee may apply. Your Reload may not be fully processed until the next working day after payment is made by you, and the balance on your Account will normally not be increased until such processing is complete. See our website or call Customer Services on 0870 144 0289 for current information on designated outlets and other information concerning Reloading your Account. It is your responsibility to ensure that you reload the correct Account. When you reload at an outlet, you should request and keep the receipt which confirms the Reload. 1.3 Unless we inform you otherwise (for example, if you only qualify for a Card with lower limits), you may Reload your Account up to 5 times daily with a minimum per Reload of £10 and a maximum per Reload which depends on the method of Reload but will not exceed £2,500, provided that the balance on your Account never exceeds £5,000 and the total Reloaded on your Account in a calendar year does not exceed £12,000. We reserve the right to vary these limits and to decline or suspend any Reload at any time and will notify you as soon as is reasonably practical in the circumstances. 1.4 The Available Funds on your Account will not earn any interest. 1.5 As your Card is a prepaid card and not a credit card, you must ensure that you have sufficient Available Funds loaded on your Account to pay for each purchase, payment or cash withdrawal that you make using your Card (including value added tax and any other taxes, charges and fees that are applicable). If for any reason a Transaction is processed with your Card where the Transaction amount exceeds the Available Funds on your Account, you (the Primary Registered Person) must repay us the amount of such excess immediately. 1.6 Your rights and obligations in relation to your Card and Account are as set out in this Agreement. This Agreement does not give you any rights against MasterCard International, its affiliates or any third party. By applying to upgrade your Card Account to become a Higher Limit Reloadable Account, you agree to this Agreement. 1.7 The Card remains our property at all times. 1.8 Only persons over 18 years of age are entitled to register for an upgraded Account. However, if you are the Primary Registered Person you may allow the Card and Account to be accessed by your own child (or a child of whom you are the legal guardian) who is between 13 and 18 years of age in accordance with Condition 2.7 or 2.8. However, Transactions by such a child may not be allowed by some Merchants. 2. Use of your Card 2.1 You can use your Card up to the amount of the Available Funds to enter into Transactions at Merchants displaying the MasterCard acceptance mark, including Transactions with Merchants over the internet, by phone or by mail order. If the Available Funds are insufficient to pay for the Transaction, some Merchants will not permit you to combine use of the Card with other payment methods, e.g. cheque, cash or another payment card. 2.2 Your Card can be used to make cash withdrawals from ATMs and banks who agree to provide this service, up to a total of £120 per day (or £500 per day for certain Cards which were initially purchased via our website) and subject to any maximum set by the relevant ATM operator or bank (unless we inform you otherwise).<br>
2.3 The value of each Transaction and the amount of any fees or charges payable by you under this Agreement will be deducted from the Available Funds. 2.4 In order to protect you and us from fraud, Merchants and ATM operators will seek authorisation before processing any Transaction. If a Merchant or ATM operator is unable to get an online authorisation from us, he may not be able to authorise your Transaction. 2.5 We may refuse to authorise any use of your Card which would or could breach these Consumer Terms &amp; Conditions or if we have reasonable grounds for suspecting that you or a third party have committed or are planning to commit fraud or any other offence with the use of, or in connection with, your Card or Account. 2.6 All the parties agree: (a) A Transaction Fee is payable in respect of each Transaction (other than a cash withdrawal). (b) A Cash Withdrawal Fee is payable in respect of cash withdrawals made using your Card. Your withdrawal may also be subject to any applicable fees, rules and regulations of the relevant ATM operator or bank. It is your responsibility to check whether any such additional fees apply, as they cannot be refunded once the cash has been withdrawn. 2.7 If you are the Primary Registered Person, you may allow your Card and Account to be operated by your own child (this includes a child of whom you are the legal guardian) who is between 13 and 18 years of age provided you have previously successfully registered his details with us and the Card is then used only by that child. You remain solely bound by these Consumer Terms &amp; Conditions. You (the Primary Registered Person) will remain responsible for the use of the Card and the Account, and for any fees and charges incurred by your child, and you will continue to be regarded as the holder of any e-money already or subsequently loaded on the Account. You shall be deemed to have consented to all Transactions consented to by your child. You will not be able to register your child’s details if you have already successfully registered a Second Cardholder for your Account. 2.8 All the parties agree: (a) If you are the Primary Registered Person, you may apply to us to have a Second Cardholder registered for your Account. If you successfully register, we will send you a Second Card, for which we will charge a Second Card Fee. Upon receipt of the Second Card, you may give the Second Card to the Second Cardholder for his use, subject to (i) you providing him with a copy of these Consumer Terms &amp; Conditions, (ii) the Second Card then being used only by that person, (iii) you retaining the Original Card, and (iv) you informing the Second Cardholder that you have retained the Original Card and that you are still able to use the Account. This Agreement shall bind both you and the Second Cardholder and shall be interpreted accordingly. You (the Primary Registered Person) will remain responsible for the use of both Cards and the Account, and for any fees and charges incurred by the Second Cardholder, and you will continue to be regarded as the holder of any e-money already or subsequently loaded on the Account. The use of a Second Card registered to a Second Cardholder will be regarded as confirmation that you have provided the Second Cardholder with these Consumer Terms &amp; Conditions and he has accepted them. (b) Children under 18 may not be registered as a Second Cardholder, unless they are over 13 and you (the Primary Registered Person) are the child’s parent or legal guardian. The terms of Condition 2.8(a) will apply subject to following changes: (i) you (the Primary Registered Person) remain solely bound by these Consumer Terms &amp; Conditions, and (ii) you shall be deemed to have consented to all Transactions consented to by your child. 2.9 If you have been issued with a replacement Card for any reason, then you must destroy your old Card immediately, unless we inform you otherwise. 2.10 Your ability to use or access your Card and Account may occasionally be interrupted, for example if we need to carry out maintenance on our systems. Please call Customer Services on 0870 144 0289 to notify us of any problems you are experiencing using your Card and we will use reasonable endeavors to deal with the problem. 2.11 You consent to each Transaction made using the Card by following the instructions provided by the Merchant to authorise the Transaction. Such consent cannot be withdrawn. 2.12 Funds to cover an authorised Transaction will be paid by us to the Merchant Acquirer on the next business day after receipt of the relevant instruction where the Merchant Acquirer is located within the<br>
European Economic Area, otherwise the funds will be paid over as soon as reasonably practicable (subject to circumstances beyond our control). 2.13 You agree: (a) to use the Card in accordance with the Consumer Terms &amp; Conditions; and (b) to notify us, without any undue delay, on becoming aware of the loss, theft or misappropriation of the Card, or its unauthorised use (see Condition 12). 3. Special use of your Card 3.1 In some circumstances we or Merchants may require you to have Available Funds in excess of the Transaction amount. For instance, at restaurants you may be required to have 20% more on your Card than the value of the bill to allow for any service charge added by the restaurant. 3.2 Merchants may require verification that your Available Funds will cover the Transaction amount and initiate a hold on your Available Funds in that amount. 3.3 You will not be able to use your Card at “pay-at-pump” petrol pumps. However, you will normally be able to use your Card to pay for petrol by presenting the Card at the kiosk or to a service station attendant. 3.4 Some Merchants may not accept your Card. It is your responsibility to check the position with each Merchant. We accept no liability if a Merchant refuses to accept your Card. 3.5 If you set up a recurring payment or regular subscription using your Card, you must ensure that there are sufficient Available Funds to cover such payments. We will charge you a Reject Processing Fee if you fail to do so. 4. Card Details, PIN and Accessing your Account Details 4.1 You should keep a record of your 16-digit Card number, in case you lose it. 4.2 The User must sign the signature strip on the Card immediately when received. In the case of cards which you are allowing your child to use or Second Cardholders, you must ensure that you do not sign a Card unless you are the User. 4.3 A personal identification number (“PIN”) will have been provided for use with your Card at the time that it was initially purchased. Your Card’s PIN will be the same as it was immediately prior to the upgrade of your Account to a fully Higher Limit Reloadable Account. You (and any Second Cardholder) will need this PIN in order to make cash withdrawals from an ATM or at a Bank, and also to complete most Transactions. If you forget your PIN, you should call Customer Services for either a PIN reminder or a replacement PIN, which will be sent out to the Primary Registered Person. You will be charged a PIN Service Fee 4.4 In some countries, including the USA, a Merchant may ask you to enter a four digit PIN to complete your Transaction, even though the Merchant’s equipment is not designed for use with Chip &amp; PIN payment cards. In such cases, you should offer to provide your signature instead although this may not be accepted, in which case you cannot use your Card with that Merchant) 4.5 You may request that we send you a copy of the current Consumer Terms &amp; Conditions. 5. Registered Information<br>
5.1 If you enter into Transactions over the internet, some websites require you to enter your name and address. In such cases you should supply the most recent address which has been registered with us by the Primary Registered Person as the Account address. 5.2 The Account address is also the address to which we will send any correspondence, and must always be a UK address. 5.3 You (the Primary Registered Person) must notify us within seven days of any change in the Account address or your other contact details. You can notify us by contacting Customer Services, who may require you to confirm such notification in writing. You will be liable for any loss or fraud that directly results from any failure to notify us of such a change. We may need to verify your new Account address. 6. Customer Identification<br>
We reserve the right at any time to satisfy ourselves as to your identity and home address for the purposes of preventing fraud and/or money laundering by requiring you to provide us with information (for example, by requesting relevant original documents). . We may also conduct electronic searches regarding your identity and home address; these searches may result in a search footprint which could be accessed by other financial institutions. 7. Safeguarding your Card and Account 7.1 The Card and Account may only be used by the Primary Registered Person or, where a Card has been either (i) passed to your child to use (in accordance with Condition 2.7), or (ii) given to a person for use as a Second Cardholder (in accordance with Condition 2.8), by that person. You must not give the Card to any other person or allow any other person to use the Card or Account. You must keep the Card in a safe place, and not use the Card on a website in circumstances where the website’s security is in doubt. 7.2 You must keep your PIN safe at all times. This includes:<br>
(a) Memorising your PIN as soon as you receive it, and destroying the letter or other document on which we provided the PIN to you immediately. If you need to write down your PIN in order to help you remember it, you must make sure it is well disguised. (b) Never writing your PIN on your Card or on anything you usually keep with your Card. (c) Keeping your PIN secret at all times, including by not using your PIN if anyone else is watching. (d) Not disclosing your PIN to any person, except that you may disclose the PIN orally (but not in writing) to a person authorised (by Condition 2.7 or 2.8 of these Consumer Terms &amp; Conditions) to use your Card or Account.<br>
Failure to comply with this Condition 7.2 may be treated as gross negligence and may affect your ability to claim any losses. NEVER COMMUNICATE YOUR PIN TO ANYONE IN WRITING. This includes printed messages, e-mails and online forms. 7.3 If you suspect that someone who is not authorised to use your Card or Account knows your PIN, you should change your PIN immediately. You (the Primary Registered Person) can do this by contacting us and requesting that we issue you with a new PIN. You will be charged a PIN Service Fee. 7.4 You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless against any fraudulent use made of your Card or Account by you or any person authorised by you. 7.5 If you act fraudulently and this causes losses, you will normally be responsible for such losses. 7.6 Once your Card has expired or if it is found after you have reported it as lost or stolen (or – if there is a Second Cardholder – in any case where the Account’s other Card has been reported as lost or stolen) you should destroy your Card by cutting it in two through the magnetic strip.<br>
8. Keeping you Informed 8.1 We will not send you a statement. However, you can check your Available Funds and Transaction history at any time by visiting our website www.idtprime.com or calling us on 0870 144 0289. This service is free but all telephone calls are charged at the national calling rate (if using a BT landline). PLEASE NOTE: The details of your Available Funds and your Transaction history can potentially be accessed via this service by any person (whether or not authorised by you) who knows your Card number. However, the service does not permit access to any other information about you (such as your name or address, or any other personal identification details which you have registered with us under Condition 5). Furthermore, the details of your Transactions (but not the amounts of the Transaction) will be password-protected.<br>
8.2 We also offer an optional SMS Text Balance Service, which allows you to receive an SMS text showing your current balance every morning, provided at least one Transaction or reload has taken place in relation to your Account during the previous 24 hours. You can register for this service on our website www.idtprime.com. If you choose to register for this service, a monthly SMS Text Balance Fee will be deducted from your funds at the beginning of each month for the duration of the period for which you remain registered for this service. 9. Cancellation of your Card(s) and Account 9.1 Cancellation 9.1.1 If you wish to cancel your Card(s) and Account at any time, you must return your Card(s) cut in half through the magnetic strip to Customer Services, IDT Financial Services Limited, PO Box 1374, Gibraltar. For the avoidance of doubt, Condition 9.2 as amended by Condition 9.1.2 applies when you cancel your Card(s) and Account. Therefore you must also comply with requirements of Condition 9.2.1 if you wish to redeem any of the funds on your Account. 9.1.2 We do not charge a cancellation fee if you cancel the Card(s) and Account after 12 months from the date you upgraded the Card Account to a Higher Limit Reloadable Account (or otherwise acquired the Card as a Reloadable Card) and you redeem funds from your Account. In such circumstances we do not charge a Redemption Fee but we will deduct an ID Document Processing Fee for processing your identification documents (as specified in Condition 9.2.1(b)). In all other circumstances we will charge a Redemption Fee and an ID Document Processing Fee. 9.1.3 This Agreement will terminate 90 days after the Card(s) and Account are cancelled. The value (e-money) on your Account will no longer be valid once 90 days have elapsed after the cancellation and you will no longer be able to redeem any unused value remaining on the Account. 9.1.4 If, following cancellation of your Card(s) and Account, any further Transactions are found to have been made, or charges or fees incurred using your Card, we will: (a) deduct these from your Available Funds (if any); or (b) notify you of the amount and you must immediately repay to us the amount on demand. 9.2 Redemption 9.2.1 If you (the Primary Registered Person) wish to redeem money from your Account at any time (including after the cancellation or expiry of your Card(s) and Account), you must: (a) call our Customer Services on 0870 144 0289 informing them of your wish to redeem money from your Account; and (b) write to us at Customer Services, IDT Financial Services Limited, PO Box 1374, Gibraltar confirming your request, quoting your Card number and enclosing a photocopy of your passport (i.e. the picture page) and a copy of a recent (less than 3 months old) utility bill bearing your name and address, in each case certified as<br>
being a true copy of the original by a suitable professional (for example, lawyer, accountant, teacher, doctor, police officer, post office official, chemist, local government officer) providing his own contact details. 9.2.2 Once we have received all the necessary information from you (the Primary Registered Person) and all Transactions and applicable fees and charges have been processed, we will provide you with the requested amount of funds (“Requested Funds”) less any fees and charges payable to us, provided that: (a) we do not have reasonable grounds to believe that you have acted fraudulently; and (b) we are not required to withhold your Available Funds by law or regulation, or at the request of the police, a court or any regulatory authority. 9.2.3 We will transfer the Requested Funds, less any deductions referred to above, to you (the Primary Registered Person) by bank transfer (less any bank charges) to your nominated UK bank account in your name. We may in our discretion transfer the Requested Funds to you by another payment method. We will charge a Redemption Fee and an ID Document Processing Fee. 9.2.4 If, following a redemption of funds, Transactions are found to have been made, or charges or fees incurred using your Card that exceed your Available Funds, we will notify you of the amount of the difference and you must immediately repay to us the amount on demand. 9.3 Your right to withdraw 9.3.1 You (the Primary Registered Person) have a period of 14 days beginning on the date of the successful registration of your Reloadable Account, to withdraw from this agreement and cancel the Card(s) and Account, without any penalty or charge. You must contact us within this 14 day period and inform us that you wish to withdraw from this Agreement. If so, we will cancel the Card(s) and Account and reimburse the amount of Available Funds on the Account to you (the Primary Registered Person). However, we reserve the right to hold available funds for up to 20 business days from receipt of your instructions before returning the balance, to ensure that details of all transactions have been received. 9.3.2 After this 14 day period, you may only cancel the Card(s) and Account as described in Conditions 9.1 and 9.2 above. 10. Expiry of your Card and funds on the Account 10.1 Your Card has an expiry date printed on it. This date will always be at least one year after the date on which the Original Card was purchased. Your Card will expire on the expiry date. If a Card expires before your Available Funds are exhausted, you (the Primary Registered Person) can contact us on 0870 144 0289 to request a replacement Card, provided you do so within 90 days of the expiry date (or by the date 12 months after the most recent loading of funds on the Account which took place prior to the expiry date, if this is later). We will then issue you with a replacement Card against payment of a Card Replacement Fee (NB we can also issue a replacement Card for a Second Cardholder). Alternatively you (the Primary Registered Person) can redeem the Available Funds on the Account in accordance with Condition 9, provided you do so within 90 days of the expiry date (or by the date 12 months after the most recent loading of funds on the Account which took place prior to the expiry date, if this is later). You may not use your Card(s) after the expiry date.<br>
10.2 The value (e-money) on your Account will no longer be valid once 90 days have elapsed after the expiry date shown on your Card, or 12 months have passed since the most recent loading of funds on your Account prior to the expiry date if this is later. If you fail to request a replacement Card and fail to redeem the Available Funds within 90 days of the expiry date or by the date 12 months after the most recent loading of funds on the Account which took place prior to the expiry date, if this is later, you will no longer be able to redeem or use any unused value remaining on the Account.<br>
10.3 We reserve the right to issue you with a replacement for an expired Card even if you have not requested one. If you have not requested a replacement Card, you will not be charged a Card Replacement Fee. 10.4 This Agreement will terminate when your Card(s) have expired and your Account has no Available Funds.<br>
10.5 We may terminate this Agreement with two months’ notice. The notice will be sent to you using the contact information that you have registered with us. The notice of termination will result in us immediately blocking your Card(s) for the security of your Account. Termination will cause the Card(s) to expire and you can redeem any Available Funds in accordance with Condition 9. We will not charge you a Redemption Fee but we will deduct an ID Document Processing Fee. 10.6 All obligations and duties that either expressly or by their nature extends beyond the termination of this Agreement will continue to be in force after the termination of this Agreement. 11. Blocking the Use of your Card and Account and Refusing Transactions 11.1 We may block, for such period as may reasonably be required, the use of the Card(s) and the Account at any time: (a) for any reason related to the security of the Card(s) or the Account; or (b) if we suspect the unauthorised or fraudulent use of the Card(s) or the Account. 11.2 We will inform you of the blocking of the Card(s) and the Account and the reasons for the blocking where possible in advance and at the latest immediately after unless prohibited from doing so by law or for security reasons. 11.3 We will either unblock the Card(s) or replace with new Card(s) and unblock the Account once the conditions for blocking the Card(s) and the Account no longer exist. We may charge for a replacement Card if we believe you have acted negligently. 11.4 We may refuse any Transaction if we suspect the Transaction: (a) is unauthorised or fraudulent; or (b) will result in any other breach of the Consumer Terms &amp; Conditions. 11.5 Except where Condition 11.7 applies, we will notify you of such a refusal, if possible the reason for the refusal, and where relevant the procedure for rectifying any factual error that led to the refusal. We will make no notification of refusal (i) if we are prohibited by law or (ii) where there are objectively justified security reasons for doing so. 11.6 We may charge you a Transaction Fee for any refused Transaction that you authorised. 11.7 For the avoidance of doubt, we will refuse a Transaction if you have insufficient Available Funds. The refusal of such a Transaction will constitute notice to you that the Transaction has been refused because you do not have sufficient Available Funds for the Transaction. 12. Misuse, Loss or Theft of your Card 12.1 You should treat your Card like cash in your wallet and look after it accordingly. If you lose your Card or it is stolen, you may not be able to recover the funds (e-money) on your Account, in just the same way as you would usually not be able to recover cash which you lose or which is stolen from you. 12.2 If your Card is lost or stolen or if you think someone is using your Card or your Account without your permission or if your Card is damaged or malfunctions: (a) you must contact us immediately on 0870 144 0289; and (b) you must provide us with your Card number some identifying details acceptable to us so that we can be sure we are speaking to you,<br>
