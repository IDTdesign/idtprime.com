<h3 id="problem">Problems using your Prime Card</h3>

<h4>How do I return an unused card or reclaim an outstanding account balance from my card?</h4>

If you have bought a card in a shop and the pack is still unopened, you may be able to return the pack to the shop for a full refund from the retailer. This will be at the retailer’s discretion. If the retailer will not offer you a refund, or if you would like to return a card bought from the Prime website, or if you want to reclaim an outstanding account balance on a used card, you will need to follow these steps:

1) Make sure you have activated your card. (If the pack is unopened, you will need to open the pack and use the Account Code to activate the card.)

2) Call our Customer Services on 0870 144 0289/0870 034 0030 quoting your 16-digit card number, informing them of your wish to reclaim funds. Customer Services will then suspend your card and ask for your name and address.

3) Write to us at Customer Services, IDT Financial Services Limited, PO Box 1374, Gibraltar, confirming your request. Quote your card number and enclose a photocopy of your passport (on the picture page) and a copy of a recent (less than 3 months old) utility bill showing your name and address. Each document must be certified as being a true copy of the original by a suitable professional (for example; a lawyer, accountant, teacher, doctor, police officer, post office official, chemist, local government officer), providing his/her own contact details.

Once we receive this information, any remaining funds in your account will be reimbursed to you. We reserve the right to contact you where appropriate, and to charge you for all transactions made with the card and applicable fees. A £5 account balance reclaim fee will be applied. See <a href="http://www.idtprime.com/terms.html">terms and conditions</a> for full details.


<h4>What happens if money is taken from my card for a purchase I didn’t make?</h4>

If you believe your card has been used for an unauthorised or incorrect transaction, you can claim for a refund by phoning Customer Services on 0870 144 0289/0870 034 0030 or by writing to us within 14 days, with receipts if you can. If your claim is justified, we will credit the transaction amount back to your account.


<h4>Can a store refuse to accept my card because it has no Chip or PIN?</h4>

Not in the UK. Cards do not need to have a chip on them and retailers must accept all cards, even those without chips. However, in some countries, for example the USA, PINs are used for even non-chip cards. Explain that no PIN was issued with this UK prepaid MasterCard and ask to sign in the usual way.


<h4>Why is my card not working at a petrol station?</h4>

Prime Cards will not work at 'pay at pump' facilities. However, your card should be accepted at the forecourt kiosk if it accepts MasterCard.


<h4>My Prime Card is not being accepted. Why?</h4>

Check whether it could be any of these reasons:

• You haven't activated your card. To do so, please call freephone 0808 168 3556 with your Prime Card number ready.

• A Prime Card cannot be used on old-style manual imprint machines and may not be accepted whilst travelling on planes and trains.

• If the card user is under 18, the card may have been blocked at an 'unsuitable' website or retailer.

• You are trying to make a purchase on a website that requires you to enter a name and address, but have not first registered a username and address with us. <a href="https://extraapp2008/svpeuro/register/home/login/prime/">Registering</a> your card couldn't be simpler and only takes a few seconds to complete.

• The location where you are trying to make a purchase does not accept MasterCard payment cards.

• You are trying to make a purchase at a bank or financial institution that also pays out cash. As cash-back is not supported by this card, all purchases from such locations have been blocked.

• You don't have enough money left on the card. You can check your account balance at any time online or by calling Customer Services on 0870 144 0289/0870 034 0030.

<h4>What is a pre-authorisation?</h4>

A pre-authorisation is when a merchant reserves funds on your card to ensure payment of services. Often, this is done by restaurants, hotels and car rental outlets. For example, a restaurant may pre-authorise a set amount when you open a tab at the bar. If your final bill is less than the pre-authorised amount, then they will refund the difference to your account. However, they may not always do this straight away. The refund may take place up to several days later.


<h4>Why is my account balance sometimes different from the money that should be available on the card?</h4>

If a merchant has carried out a pre-authorisation (see above), and reserved more funds from your card than you actually spent, your account balance may appear lower than it should for a few days until they refund the money they owe you.

<h4>What happens if I need to return an item I bought with my Prime Card?</h4>

The retailer will handle the return according to their normal refund policy.

<p style="text-align: right;"><a title="TOP" href="#">TOP</a></p>

<h3 id="active">Activation and Registration</h3>

<h4>What's the difference between activation and registration?</h4>

Activation refers to the process you need to follow to start using your card once you have bought it, it is only required for cards delivered by post and this is explained below.

<a href="https://extraapp2008/svpeuro/register/home/login/prime/">Registration</a> is a useful way to further protect your card. Also, if you register, you can make purchases over the telephone and on those websites that require you to enter your name and address to make an online purchase.

You have to activate your card to use it but you don’t need to register it to start shopping.

<h4>What's the difference between registering and upgrading?</h4>

Registration, as explained above, offers additional security for your funds. Also, if you register, you can make purchases over the telephone and on those websites that require you to enter a name and address to make an online purchase. Upgrading gives your card higher load and spend limits as well as enabling ATM access to withdraw funds from an ATM.

<h4>How do I activate my card so I can start using it?</h4>

Cards purchased in retailer stores do not need any activation. If you have purchase the card online or if you have received a replacement card you can activate your card by calling freephone 0808 168 3556. You'll be asked for your 16-digit Prime Card number. The signature strip should be signed immediately by the card user.

<h4>Do I have to register my details?</h4>

No, but there are good reasons to do it.

Firstly, if your card is lost or stolen, as long as you know your card number and CVV, we can cancel your card and transfer your account balance onto a new card for a fee.

Secondly, registering enables you to make more ‘card not present’ purchases. This is when you are shopping on certain websites or over the phone and you’re asked for a registered name and address.

<h4>How do I register?</h4>

Register your details for free online. Simply enter your name and address that you can then quote when making a purchase. Register online now by clicking <a href="https://extraapp2008/svpeuro/register/home/login/prime/">here</a>.

<h4>Do I need to register my details immediately?</h4>

No, once you have activated your Prime Card you can start using it immediately. If you choose to do so, you can then register whenever you like.

<h4>Once I have registered can I change my details?</h4>

Yes, you can change all your registered details except for your date of birth. Just go to <a href="https://extraapp2008:4431/svp/us/account/prime/">My Account</a>. However, if you have applied for a reloadable upgrade, you will be prohibited from editing certain personal details.

<h4>Will my registration details be replaced even if I do not successfully upgrade?</h4>

Yes. As soon as you hit the submit button on the upgrade form online, or as soon as we receive your form if you apply by post, the details you submit will replace those previously held on our system.

Assuming your application is successful, you will also be able to use the card to withdraw cash at any ATM worldwide displaying the MasterCard<sup>®</sup> Acceptance Mark.

<h4>How do I upgrade my card and how long will it take?</h4>

Complete and submit the form which can be found <a href="https://extraapp2008:4431/svp/us/upgrade/prime/">here</a>. You will be sent an email within 5 working days to inform you of the outcome of your application.

The most hassle-free and convenient method for you to apply for a higher limits upgrade is via our website at<a href="http://www.idtprime.com/">www.idtprime.com</a>.
<h4>Will my application for an upgrade be successful?</h4>
When applying for an upgrade, we will ask you to supply information about your ID. If we can verify all of your ID, your application will be successful. In some cases, we may require further documentation from you.
<h4>What happens if my application for an upgrade is unsuccessful?</h4>
If your upgrade application is unsuccessful, this will not have any impact on your existing Prime Card and you will not incur a fee for the process. You can carry on using the card as you had been doing previously. In such a case, we strongly encourage you to submit certified documentation as described in the postal application option. Please note that the information you submitted when applying will replace any previous registered details.
<h4>Will you perform a credit check when I apply for an upgrade?</h4>
No. We do not perform any credit checks for Prime Card purchases or Prime Card higher limits upgrades.
<h4>How much does it cost to upgrade my card?</h4>
It costs £1.95 to upgrade your card. If you wish to order a second card, there will be an additional £5 fee (i.e. a total upgrade fee of £6.95). The amounts will be deducted from your Prime Card balance. If your upgrade request is unsuccessful you will not be charged.
<h4>Is there a minimum balance I am required to have on my Prime Card to perform an upgrade?</h4>
Yes. You will need to have enough funds to cover the upgrade fee, which is £1.95. If you are also ordering a second card, the fee is £6.95 so you will need to have this amount on your card.
<h4>My card will expire soon. Can I get a replacement card with a new expiry date?</h4>
A few weeks before your card expires you should call us explaining the situation and specifically request a replacement card
<h4>Do I need to be over 18 to upgrade my card?</h4>
For security reasons, a parent or guardian of over 18 years of age will need to carry out the upgrade application on your behalf and name you on the card account.
<h4 id="2">ORDERING A SECOND CARD</h4>
<h4>Can I also get a second card?</h4>
Yes.
<h4>Why would I want a second card?</h4>
There are two reasons why you might want a second card:
<strong>(1)</strong> We can personalise your second card, printing your name on the front.
<strong>(2)</strong> You may want to send a card to a relative at home or abroad. You will be able to use the first card to load money onto the account, and they will be able to withdraw the money at an ATM or use their card to make purchases online or at over 24 million locations worldwide.
<h4>Is there a risk attached to having a second card sent out?</h4>
To protect yourself from financial loss, you should keep a low balance on your card until you have received your new second card. As this new card is identical to your old card we are unable to suspend it without suspending both cards. If you wish, you can request that Customer Services suspends both cards until you receive your second card and notify us to activate your cards again.
<h4>If I have ordered a second card, when will it arrive?</h4>
You should receive your second Prime Card within 14 days of your upgrade being approved. In most cases you will receive it within 7-9 days.
<h4>If I have been sent a second card, can I still use my original card?</h4>
When applying for a second card, we will ask you if you intend to use that second card for yourself or to allow someone else to share your account. If you informed us that you will be sharing your account with someone else, you must retain the old card for yourself and it will continue to work, sharing the same account and funds as the new card. However, if you alone will be using your Prime Card account, you must destroy the old card by cutting it in two upon receipt of your new second card.
<h4>Do I need to activate my new card upon receipt?</h4>
Where a second card is sent out, no activation is required. However, where a lost/stolen replacement card is sent out, activation is required.
<h4>Will my new second card have a name printed on it?</h4>
When you apply for your upgrade you will be required to enter the name of the person who will be bearing the card. The name entered will be printed at the bottom left-hand corner of your new card.
<h4>Will my new second card have the same card number and expiry date as the first?</h4>
Yes, where you have ordered a second card on the same account it will have the same card number and expiry date. However, when your card is a few weeks away from expiry you may specifically request a replacement card with an expiry date 3 years from date of order. Please contact Customer Services on 0870 144 0289/0870 034 0030 if you wish to do so.
<h4>I’m a second cardholder and I want to make a purchase online. The website is asking me to enter an address as part of the purchase process. What address do I use?</h4>
If the website asks for just one address, please use the address most recently registered with IDT Prime by the Primary cardholder. If the website asks for a billing address and a delivery address, please use the address most recently registered with IDT Prime as the correspondence address, and an address of your choice for delivery.
<h4 id="3">ATMs</h4>
When applying for an upgrade, we will ask you to supply information about your ID. If we can verify all of your ID, your application will be successful and you can immediately start reloading your existing card and using it to withdraw cash from ATMs.
<h4>How will I receive my PIN?</h4>
When purchasing your card at a retailer store, the PIN will be printed on the inside of the card pack. Cards purchased online will have the PIN shipped to the address registered with the card.

If you have not ordered a second card, you will receive your PIN enclosed within a secure letter, which is specifically designed to carry sensitive bank data.

Similarly, if you have ordered a second card, your PIN will also be enclosed within a secure letter. This will be posted to you separately from your second card.

Once you receive this letter, we recommend that you memorise your PIN and destroy the letter. If you need to write your PIN down to help you remember it, please do so in a secure and disguised manner.
<h4>Can I change my PIN?</h4>
Yes, you can change your PIN at an ATM.
<h4>What is the fee to use an ATM and how much can I withdraw per day?</h4>
A fee of 75p will be levied for ATM withdrawals in the UK, and £1.50 for ATM withdrawals made abroad. You can withdraw a maximum of £500 per day (on an upgraded card) of your funds from your Prime Card account.

<h4>Is there a fee when I buy a Prime Card?</h4>
Yes, you pay a one-off £5 fee for the card on top of the amount you prepay to put on the card.
<h4>Is there a fee when I upgrade my card?</h4>
If your application is successful, you will be charged £1.95. If you have also ordered a second reloadable card, there will be an additional £5 fee (i.e. a total upgrade fee of £6.95). The amount will be deducted from your Prime Card balance. If your upgrade request is unsuccessful you will not be charged.
<h4>Is there a transaction fee?</h4>
Yes. There is a fee of between 50p and £1 depending on the value of your transaction.. For a full explanation of how the transaction fee is calculated, please see the fees section of the Terms and Conditions enclosed in your Prime Card package, or online <a href="http://www.idtprime.com/terms.html">here</a>. The maximum transaction fee has been capped at £1, regardless of the value of the transaction. So, if you book a holiday for, say, £450, we will only charge you a transaction fee of £1.
<h4>Is there an extra fee for using a debit or credit card to buy a Prime Card online?</h4>
No, there is no additional fee.

<h3 id="security">PRIME SECURITY</h3>
<h4>How secure is my card?</h4>
Our systems are highly secure. However, you should treat your card like cash. Always keep it on you. If you lose your card, we can cancel it and send you a replacement (for a small fee).
<h4>Am I protected if my card is lost or stolen?</h4>
You should treat your card just as carefully as you treat the cash in your pocket.

If your card has been lost or stolen, please call Customer Services. You will need your 16-digit card number and your security Question and Answer. We will then cancel your card and, as long as there’s still an account balance on your card, we’ll send you a replacement card (for a fee).

To arrange for a replacement card, we will need your name, address and email. If you have already registered with us or upgraded your card to reloadable, we will already have your name and address. If not, you will need to provide these details when speaking to Customer Services. You will receive your new card within 7-10 working days.
<h4>What should I do with my card when there is no account balance remaining or when it has expired?</h4>
If you no longer wish to use the card or it has expired, please destroy it by cutting it in two through the magnetic strip.
