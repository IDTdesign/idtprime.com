<p>
Terms and Conditions<br>
Please note: if you successfully upgrade your Prime Card to become<br>
reloadable, a different set of terms and conditions will apply –<br>
see our website at www.idtprime.com<br>
1. Your Card<br>
1.1 Your Card is a prepaid electronic money (e-money) payment<br>
card. It is not a credit card.<br>
1.2 When you purchase your Card at a retail store, the retailer will<br>
load it with the amount of e-money that you purchase, subject<br>
to the available denominations as well as a maximum of £150<br>
(or less, if we so require) and a minimum of £10. When you<br>
purchase a card via our website which may be found at<br>
www.idtprime.com, the maximum load is £500. The money<br>
loaded onto your Card is then available for you to spend once<br>
you activate your Card.<br>
1.3 You cannot load additional sums onto your Card after you have<br>
purchased your Card. You can, however, purchase more Cards.<br>
Also, you may be able to upgrade your Card to a Prime<br>
reloadable card (subject to applicable terms and conditions)<br>
once this facility is available.<br>
1.4 The Available Funds on your Card will not earn any interest.<br>
1.5 As your Card is a prepaid card and not a credit card, you must<br>
ensure that you have sufficient Available Funds on your Card to<br>
pay for each purchase or payment that you make using your<br>
Card (including value added tax and any other taxes, charges<br>
and fees that are applicable). If for any reason a Transaction is<br>
processed with your Card where the Transaction amount<br>
exceeds the Available Funds on your Card, you must repay us<br>
the amount of such excess immediately.<br>
1.6 Your rights and obligations in relation to your Card are as set out<br>
in this Agreement. This Agreement does not give you any rights<br>
against MasterCard International, its affiliates or any third party.<br>
1.7 The Card remains our property at all times.<br>
1.8 Only persons over 18 years of age are entitled to purchase the<br>
Card. Once purchased, the Card may be given to another<br>
person, including a person under 18 years of age. However,<br>
Transactions by persons under 18 years of age may not be<br>
allowed by some Merchants.<br>
2. Use of your Card<br>
2.1 You can use your Card up to the amount of the Available Funds to<br>
enter into Transactions at Merchants displaying the MasterCard<br>
acceptance mark, including Transactions with Merchants over<br>
the internet, by phone or mail order. If the Available Funds are<br>
insufficient to pay for the Transaction, some Merchants will not<br>
permit you to combine use of the Card with other payment<br>
methods, e.g. cheque, cash or another payment card.<br>
2.2 You cannot use your Card to make cash withdrawals, whether<br>
from ATMs, banks, shops, or otherwise. You will also be unable<br>
to use your Card with some Merchants who provide services<br>
which include the remittance of money or other services<br>
involving cash<br>
2.3 The value of each Transaction and the amount of any fees or<br>
charges payable by you under this Agreement will be deducted<br>
from the Available Funds.<br>
2.4 In order to protect you and us from fraud, Merchants will seek<br>
authorisation before processing any Transaction. If a Merchant<br>
is unable to get an online authorisation from us, he may not be<br>
able to authorise your Transaction.<br>
2.5 We may refuse to authorise any use of your Card which would<br>
or could breach these terms and conditions or if we have<br>
reasonable grounds for suspecting that you or a third party<br>
have committed or are planning to commit fraud or any other<br>
offence with the use of, or in connection with, your Card.<br>
2.6 A Transaction Fee is payable in respect of each Transaction.<br>
2.7 You may gift the Card to another person subject to providing him<br>
with a copy of these terms and conditions (which will then bind<br>
both you and the person to whom you have gifted the Card) and<br>
subject to the Card then being used only by that person.<br>
3. Special use of your Card<br>
3.1 In some circumstances we or Merchants may require you to<br>
have Available Funds in excess of the Transaction amount.<br>
For instance, at restaurants you may be required to have 20%<br>
more on your Card than the value of the bill to allow for any<br>
service charge added by the restaurant.<br>
3.2 In some circumstances Merchants may require verification that<br>
your Available Funds will cover the Transaction amount and<br>
initiate a hold on your Available Funds in that amount.<br>
3.3 You will not be able to use your Card at “pay-at-pump” petrol<br>
pumps. However, you will normally be able to use your Card to<br>
pay for petrol by presenting the Card to the kiosk or to a service<br>
station attendant.<br>
3.4 If you have registered with us and notified us that you are under<br>
18, we will endeavour to prevent the Card being used for<br>
Transactions involving certain unsuitable categories of goods<br>
or services.<br>
3.5 In countries outside the UK, some Merchants may not accept<br>
your Card. It is your responsibility to check the position with<br>
each Merchant. We accept no liability if a Merchant refuses to<br>
accept your Card.<br>
4. Activating your Card and Accessing your Account Details<br>
4.1 You should make a record of your Card number immediately<br>
upon receipt, in case you lose it subsequently.<br>
4.2 The user of the Card must sign the signature strip on the Card<br>
immediately when he receives it.<br>
4.3 Before you can use your Card for the first time, you must<br>
activate it. You can do so by calling us on 0800 458 7150 and,<br>
when prompted, you must enter your Card number and the<br>
Account Code.<br>
4.4 You will receive an Account Code with your Card. You will need<br>
this Account Code to activate your Card, and to perform the<br>
following functions in relation to your Card or Account:<br>
(a) register your details;<br>
(b) check the amount of Available Funds;<br>
(c) check Transaction details;<br>
(d) transfer your Available Funds to a new Card<br>
(see Condition 8);<br>
(e) cancel your Card (see Condition 9.1); and<br>
(f) report your Card as lost or stolen.<br>
4.5 In some countries, including the USA, Merchants may ask you<br>
to enter a four digit PIN to complete your Transaction. In such<br>
cases, you should inform the Merchant that no PIN was issued<br>
with your Card, and offer to provide your signature instead<br>
(although this may not be accepted, in which case you cannot<br>
use your Card with that Merchant).<br>
4.6 For security purposes, you should keep your Account Code<br>
safe, and separate from your Card or any record of your Card<br>
number. We will not incur any liability if you fail to do so.<br>
4.7 If you lose or forget your Account Code before you register your<br>
Card, we cannot issue you with a replacement Account Code.<br>
You should, however, continue to be able to use your Card for<br>
Transactions with most Merchants.<br>
5. Registration<br>
5.1 If you want to enter into Transactions over the internet, some<br>
websites require you to enter your name and address. In order<br>
for your Card to work on these websites, you will have to<br>
register a user name and address with us. You can register<br>
either free of charge at www.idtprime.com or by telephoning us<br>
on 0870 144 0280. We will charge a Registration Fee if you<br>
register by telephone.<br>
5.2 We will ask you to quote your Card number, your Account Code<br>
and the day, month and year of your birthday in order to register<br>
your details.<br>
5.3 We reserve the right at any time to satisfy ourselves as to your<br>
identity and home address (for example, by requesting relevant<br>
original documents) including for the purposes of preventing<br>
fraud and/or money laundering.<br>
6. Safeguarding your Card<br>
6.1 The Card may only be used by the purchaser of the Card or,<br>
where the Card has been gifted to another person, by that<br>
person. You must not allow any other person to use your Card.<br>
6.2 You must not disclose your Account Code to anyone else. You<br>
must take all reasonable steps to prevent anyone else from<br>
learning your Account Code.<br>
6.3 If you believe that someone else knows your Account Code and<br>
has or may be able to access your Card number, you should<br>
contact us immediately and we will issue you with a new Card,<br>
loaded with your latest Available Funds (less a Card<br>
Replacement Fee), and a new Account Code.<br>
6.4 You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless against any<br>
fraudulent use made of your Card by you or any person<br>
authorised by you.<br>
6.5 If you act without reasonable care and this causes losses, you<br>
will normally be responsible for such losses.<br>
6.6 Once the Available Funds have been spent or the Card has<br>
expired or if it is found after you have reported it as lost or<br>
stolen, you should destroy the Card by cutting it in two through<br>
the magnetic strip.<br>
7. Keeping you Informed<br>
We will not send you a statement. However, you can check your<br>
Available Funds and Transaction history at any time by calling us on<br>
0870 144 0280 or by visiting our website www.idtprime.com and supplying<br>
your Account Code. This service is free but all telephone calls are<br>
charged at the national calling rate (if using a BT landline).<br>
8. Transferring to another Card account<br>
If you have registered your Card with us in accordance with Condition 5,<br>
you can transfer your Available Funds (provided they do not exceed £20)<br>
from your Card to a new activated Card that you have purchased, by<br>
visiting our website at www.idtprime.com, provided that the total<br>
cumulative value of e-money loaded on the new Card using this type of<br>
transfer does not exceed £500.<br>
9. Cancellation of your Card<br>
9.1 If you wish to cancel your Card at any time, you must:<br>
(a) activate your Card and register your details in accordance<br>
with Condition 5 (if you have not already done so)<br>
(b) call our Customer Services on 0870 144 0280 informing them<br>
of your wish to cancel and to claim a refund of monies.<br>
(Customer Services will then suspend all further use of your<br>
Card); and<br>
(c) write to us at Customer Services, IDT Financial Services<br>
Limited, PO Box 1374, Gibraltar confirming your request,<br>
quoting your Card number and enclosing a photocopy of<br>
your passport (on the picture page) and a copy of a recent<br>
(less than 3 months old) utility bill bearing your name and<br>
address, in each case certified as being a true copy of the<br>
original by a suitable professional (for example lawyer,<br>
accountant, teacher, doctor, police officer, post office<br>
official, chemist, local government officer) providing his<br>
own contact details.<br>
9.2 Once we have received all the necessary information from you<br>
and all Transactions and applicable fees and charges have<br>
been processed we will refund to you any Available Funds less<br>
any fees and charges payable to us, provided that:<br>
(a) your Available Funds are greater than the pounds sterling<br>
equivalent of e10 (10 Euros);<br>
(b) we do not have reasonable grounds to believe that you<br>
have acted fraudulently; and<br>
(c) we are not required to withhold your Available Funds by law<br>
or regulation, or at the request of the police, a court or any<br>
regulatory authority.<br>
We will charge a Balance Reclaim Fee.<br>
9.3 If, following reimbursement of your Available Funds, any further<br>
Transactions are found to have been made or charges or fees<br>
incurred using your Card, we will notify you of the amount and<br>
you must immediately repay to us such amount on demand.<br>
9.4 We will transfer the Available Funds, less any deductions<br>
referred to above, to you by cheque or telegraphic transfer (less<br>
any bank charges) to your nominated bank account in your<br>
name. We may in our discretion transfer the Available Funds to<br>
you by another payment method.<br>
10. Expiry of your Card<br>
10.1 Your Card has an expiry date printed on it. It is not possible to<br>
purchase a Card less than one year before the expiry date. Your<br>
Card will expire on the earlier of the expiry date and the date on<br>
which the Available Funds on your Card reach £0.00. If your<br>
Card expires before your Available Funds are exhausted, you<br>
can contact us on 0870 144 0280 to request a replacement Card,<br>
provided you do so within 90 days of the expiry date and have<br>
previously registered with us. We will then issue you with a<br>
replacement Card against payment of a Card Replacement Fee.<br>
Alternatively you can redeem the Available Funds on your<br>
expired Card in accordance with Condition 9, provided you do<br>
so within 90 days of the expiry date. You may not use your Card<br>
after the expiry date.<br>
10.2 The value (e-money) on your Account will no longer be valid<br>
once 90 days have elapsed after the expiry date shown on your<br>
Card. If you fail to request a replacement Card and fail to<br>
redeem the Available Funds within 90 days of the expiry date,<br>
you will no longer be able to redeem or use any unused value<br>
remaining on the Account.<br>
11. Ending the Use of your Card<br>
11.1 We may end or suspend, for such period as may reasonably<br>
be required, the use by you of your Card at any time, without<br>
prior notice:<br>
(a) in the event of any fault or failure in the data information<br>
processing system;<br>
(b) if we reasonably believe that you have used or are likely to<br>
use your Card, or allow it to be used, in breach of these<br>
terms and conditions or to commit an offence or that any<br>
Available Funds on your Card or any other Card issued by<br>
us to you may be at risk;<br>
(c) where we have serious grounds for doing so.<br>
If we end the use by you of your Card, we will then be able to<br>
refund your Available Funds to you, against proof to our<br>
satisfaction of your identity and that you are the user, unless we<br>
are required to withhold the Available Funds by law or<br>
regulation or at the request of the police, a court or any<br>
regulatory authority.<br>
11.2 If any Transactions are found to have been made or charges or<br>
fees incurred using your Card after any action has been taken<br>
by us under Condition 11.1, you must immediately repay such<br>
amounts to us.<br>
12. Loss or Theft of your Card<br>
12.1 You should treat the e-money on your Card like cash in your<br>
wallet and look after it accordingly. If you lose your Card or it is<br>
stolen, you may not be able to recover the e-money on it, in just<br>
the same way as you would usually not be able to recover cash<br>
which you lose or which is stolen from you.<br>
12.2 If your Card is lost or stolen or if you think someone is using<br>
it without your permission or if your Card is damaged<br>
or malfunctions:<br>
(a) you must contact us immediately on 0870 144 0280;
