<h1 class="txt_1_h1">PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL</h1>

<h2>Your transactions are safe with us.</h2>

<p>How you spend your money is your business. That's why we won't send you any statements in the post or contact you by phone/text or email – unless, of course, you specifically ask us to. Which means you can buy gifts, surprise your loved ones and enjoy your hobbies without worrying about people close to you finding out.</p>

<p>Need to buy something straight away? No problem, you can get a Prime Card instantly from a PayPoint or epay convenience store. The only information we'll need is the amount you’d like to put on the card.  Alternatively, purchase online and get a card sent out to the address you register with. </p>

<p>Prime Card is designed with your security and privacy in mind. And because you can use your pre paid card anywhere you see the MasterCard Acceptance Mark, you'll always have a discreet way to shop.</p>
