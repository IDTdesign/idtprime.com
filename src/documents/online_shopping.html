<h1 class="txt_1_h1">BE CONFIDENT ONLINE</h1>

<h2>FEEL FREE AND SECURE</h2>

<p>The Prime MasterCardÂ® isn't linked to your main bank account, so you can keep your credit and debit card details safe from online hackers. If you think your card has been compromised, you can contact us straight away. We will cancel it and send a new one to you.</p>

<p>And as Prime Card offers CVV security for your transactions, online shopping is always quick and secure.</p>

<p>You just need to register your card so that you can fill in an address as some websites request this in order to process a payment. We will not use this address to send you any information.</p>
